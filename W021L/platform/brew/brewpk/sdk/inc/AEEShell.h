   The applications can use this notification mask to receive notification 
whenever an application attempts to become top visible. The notification is
sent for success as well as failure to become top visible.

The following scenarios can cause this notification to be sent:

1. Calling ISHELL_StartApplet()

2. Using IAppHistory_Move() to cause an app to become top-visible

3. A suspended app is resumed to become top-visible

   The data sent to the applications when they register for this notification is of
type NotifyStartStatus.

Description:
   This is a notification mask that can be used by apps to register to
be notified when the application's license is changed.

   To register for this notification, applications must use the
NMASK_SHELL_APP_LICENSE_CHANGED mask.  When the application's license is
upated, the application will receive the EVT_NOTIFY event. The dwParam of
this event is of type AEENotify. The pData member inside this AEENotify
structure will point to an AEELicenseInfo structure containing the app's
current license information.

Description:
   This is a notification mask that can be used by apps to register to
be notified when the list of installed applications changes.  Applications
that wish to be notified when BREW applets are installed or deleted should
register for this notification.

   To register for this notification, applications must use the
NMASK_SHELL_MOD_LIST_CHANGED mask.  When the list of installed applications
changes, applications receive the EVT_NOTIFY event. The dwParam of this

NMASK_SHELL_KEY

Description:
   This is a notification mask that can be used by apps to register to
be notified when an individual key is pressed, even when the app is in the background.
When the specified key is pressed or released, the registered applications will receive
the EVT_NOTIFY event. The AVK code of the desired key is specified in the upper 16 bits
of dwMask when calling ISHELL_RegisterNotify.  Use NOTIFYIER_VAL_ANY for the
AVK code to receive all key events.
The dwParam of this event is of type AEENotify.  The pData member inside this AEENotify
structure is of type NotifyKeyEvent.

MPROP_STATUS

Description:
   This is a property ID that can be used in ISHELL_GetProperty() to get the status string
   of an app. Each app can set this property to its desired string. The AppMgr queries
   this string at run time and displays this string next along with the app name so as to present
   app-specific information at run time. For ex: an email client can store the number
   of new messages as a status string so that when the AppMgr presents the email client app,
   the updated status string can be shown to the user. So, without launching the email app,
   the user will be made aware of updated status info ex: number of new emails available.

NotifyKeyEvent

Description:
This data is sent to the apps when they register for NMASK_SHELL_KEY
notifications.

Definition:
typedef struct _NotifyKeyEvent {
   AEEEvent eCode;
   uint16   wParam;
   uint32   dwParam;
   AEECLSID clsHandled
} NotifyKeyEvent;

Members:

eCode:  The key event (EVT_KEY, EVT_KEY_PRESS, EVT_KEY_RELEASE)
wParam: The AVK keycode
dwParam: Bitflags for modifier keys
clsHandled: If this value is non-zero, it denotes the classId of the app that has already handled
this key event prior to the notification being sent. The following rules apply for this member:
If clsHandled is set to 0, it denotes that they key event was not handled by any application
If clsHandled is set to AEECLSID_SHELL, it denotes that the key event was handled
by BREW. The only case this is possible is when the CloseAllApps Key (typically, the END key) 
is pressed and this key was consumed by BREW to close all the active apps.
If clsHandled is set to a non-zero value (and not AEECLSID_SHELL), it denotes the classID of the
app that handled this event. As denoted in the documentation for Key Filtering and EVT_KEY_HOOK,
the key events are first sent to any applications that are registered for key hook events. if 
any of these apps handle the key event, the clsHandled is set to that of the handling application.
If none of the apps that have registered for key hook events handle the key event, then the key 
event is sent to the current top-visible app. If that top-visible app handles the key event, then
clsHandled is set to the classId of the top-visible app.  
Please note that the clsHandled member has been to this structure starting with BREW 
version 3.1.4. It may also be available on specific FeaturePackage releases of 3.1.2 and 3.1.3.

This specifies the ID of the item whose information is needed. This is used
in the function ISHELL_GetDeviceInfoEx()


Definition:
typedef int AEEDeviceItem

Members:

The following Items are supported:

~
   Name:
   AEE_DEVICEITEM_CHIP_ID
~
   Description:
   This returns a String identifying the ID of the chipset. For Qualcomm chipsets,
   these strings are of the form: MSM3100, MSM3300, MSM5100, etc.This information is returned
   as a AECHAR when ISHELL_GetDeviceInfoEx() is invoked with this ID.
   When this ID is passed to ISHELL_GetDeviceInfoEx(), the following details apply:
===pre>
   int   ISHELL_GetDeviceInfoEx(IShell *po, AEEDeviceItem nItem, void *pBuff, int *pnSize);
===/pre>

   Parameters:
      nItem: Specifies AEE_DEVICEITEM_CHIP_ID
      pBuff: Buffer capable of holding a AECHAR string
*

   Name:
   AEE_DEVICEITEM_MOBILE_ID
~
   Description:
   For CDMA networks represents 15-byte mobile number which consists of the following components:
      - mcc: mobile country code (3 digits)
      - mnc: mobile network code (2 digits)
      - min2: area code (3 digits)s
      - min1: phone number (7 digits) 
   For UMTS networks represents International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI).
   Applications that need the MDN information should use ISHELL_GetDeviceInfoEx with AEE_DEVICEITEM_MDN.
   This is the same information that is returned in the szMobileID member of the TAPIStatus structure when the function
   ITAPI_GetStatus() is invoked. The benefit of putting it here is to enable applications to obtain the MobiledID
   without having to create an ITAPI instance (and hence without needing the PL_TAPI privilege level).
   No privilege level is required to obtain the MobileID using this function.
   When this ID is passed to ISHELL_GetDeviceInfoEx(), the following details apply:
===pre>
   int   ISHELL_GetDeviceInfoEx(IShell *po, AEEDeviceItem nItem, void *pBuff, int *pnSize);
===/pre>

   Parameters:
      nItem: Specifies AEE_DEVICEITEM_MOBILE_ID

   Description:
   This returns information about a particular display.  The pBuff pointer is an AEEBitmapInfo
   structure.  NOTE: When specifying display settings in an application's MIF file, the settings
   do not take effect until the application creates an instance of the corresponding display.
   Therefore, calling ISHELL_GetDeviceInfoEx() with one of these device items before creating
   an instance of the corresponding display will return the default display dimensions.
*

   Name:
   AEE_DEVICEITEM_CARRIER_ID
~
   Description:
   This returns an uint32 value identifying the CarrierID of the handset.
   No privilege level is required to obtain the CarrierID using this function.

AEE_RES_LANGDIR

Description:
   The string that ISHELL_LoadResXXX functions recognize in filenames
    as directives to searching for localized resource files.  Any 
    occurrence of this string in the filename argument will be replaced 
    by "<lang>/", where <lang> is a string representation of 
    AEEDeviceInfo.dwLang.

Definition:
   AEE_RES_LANGDIR "{langdir}"

Version:
    Introduced BREW Client 3.1

Comments:
   BREW makes two passes over the filename passed to the ISHELL_LoadResXX
   APIs.  Once to replace {langdir} and {langsuf} with their dwLang
   equivalents, and once to replace {langdir} and {langsuf} with the empty 
   string.  After each pass, BREW attempts to open the resource file with
   the resulting string.  If opening the named file succeeds, BREW proceeds
   to load the requested resource from that file.  If the resource doesn't 
   exist in the opened file, an error is returned.  There is no further 
   fallback once the file is successfully opened.

   For example: given the filename "{langdir}app.bar" on an "en" handset, 
   BREW's ISHELL_LoadResXX() logic can be expressed as:

      int nErr;

      if (AEE_SUCCESS == (nErr == openresfile("en/app.bar", &file)) ||
          AEE_SUCCESS == (nErr == openresfile("app.bar", &file))) {
         return loadresdata(file, ...);
      }
      return nErr;

   Similarly: given the filename "app{langsuf}.bar" on an "en" handset, 
   BREW's ISHELL_LoadResXX() logic can be expressed as:

      int nErr;

      if (AEE_SUCCESS == (nErr == openresfile("app_en.bar", &file)) ||
          AEE_SUCCESS == (nErr == openresfile("app.bar", &file))) {
         return loadresdata(file, ...);
      }
      return nErr;


   Using these strings in your resource file names allows for a 
   localized application to automatically load the correct resources
   for the handset's language.  Note that applications should use
   {langdir} or {langsuf}, probably not both.

   time reaches a specified value. Unlike timers, which can be active only while your
   application is running, you can receive notification that an alarm has expired even
   when your application is not running. Alarms are typically used when the time of
   notification is in the distant future. For example, a calendar application uses
   an alarm to alert the user when a calendar appointment is about to be reached.

   To set an alarm, you call ISHELL_SetAlarm() and specify the number of minutes from
   the current time at which the alarm notification is to occur, a 16-bit alarm code,
   and the BREW ClassID of the application (yours or another) that receives notification
   when the alarm time is reached. At notification time, the IAPPLET_HandleEvent()
   function of the notified application is called with an EVT_ALARM event and the 16-bit
   alarm code as parameters. The latter parameter allows an application to distinguish
   between more than one simultaneously active alarm. If the notified application is
   not currently running, the AEE Shell creates an instance of it to process the notification
   event, after which it is terminated. The application may choose to activate itself
   if necessary. The AEE Shell stores alarms in a BREW database and continuously checks
   for alarm expirations while the BREW-enabled device is turned on. If an alarms
   expiration time passes while the device is turned off, the AEE Shell generates the
   notification the next time the device is turned on.

   ISHELL_CancelAlarm() cancels a currently active alarm. ISHELL_AlarmsActive() checks
   whether any of BREW built-in annunciators (alarm clock, countdown timer, or stopwatch)
   are currently active.
===H2>
Application management
===/H2>

   The AEE Shells application management functions have a number of purposes, including
   the following:

    -    Creating, starting, and stopping BREW classes and applications

    -    Obtaining information about the modules and classes present on the device

    -    Allowing applications to send events to each other

    -    Allowing BREW applications to run without interfering with other activities
   that the device must perform

   ISHELL_CreateInstance() creates instances of both BREW classes and of user-defined
   classes supported by the modules present on the device. ISHELL_StartApplet() allows
   a specified applet to run. It creates an instance of the applet if necessary, suspends
   the currently running applet (if any), and then invokes the specified applets IAPPLET_HandleEvent()
   function with the EVT_APP_START event, which allows it to run. ISHELL_CloseApplet()
   sends the currently running applet the EVT_APP_STOP event and calls its Release
   function. ISHELL_CloseApplet() is used primarily by the AEE Shell itself,

   ISHELL_ActiveApplet() is used to obtain the ClassID of the applet that is currently top
   visible. ISHELL_EnumAppletInit() and ISHELL_EnumNextApplet() can be used to enumerate
   the applets in the modules that are present on the device. As each applet is enumerated,
   ISHELL_EnumNextApplet() returns a pointer to an AEEAppInfo data structure for the
   applet, which identifies the applets MIF file, titles, icons, and type (game, tool,
   PIM, and other types). ISHELL_QueryClass() determines if a particular class is available
   on the device. If the class is an applet, supply a pointer to an AEEAppInfo data
   structure, which is populated with the relevant information if the applet is available.

   Use ISHELL_SendEvent() to send an event to a specified class. If an instance of
   that class is not currently present, the AEE Shell creates one and then invokes
   its IAPPLET_HandleEvent() function with the specified event code and data parameters.
   Unless it chooses to start itself, the application terminates after it completes
   processing the event. ISHELL_PostEvent() is similar, except that the destination
   classs IAPPLET_HandleEvent() function is not called immediately. The event is placed
   in a queue and is sent at a later time, which allows the calling application to
   continue its processing without interruption. ISHELL_HandleEvent() is used when
   the identity of the class that is to receive the event is not known. In this case,
   the AEE Shell sends the event to the currently running applet or its active dialog,
   if any.

   The AEE Shell includes several functions that enable BREW applications to coexist
   with other activities on the device. The BREW application model is based on cooperative
   multitasking, which means that each application must be designed to run for as short
   a time as possible when processing an event, and then exit to give other device
   activities a chance to run.

   ISHELL_Busy() lets a BREW application determine if any activities are in progress
   on the device that requires it to exit immediately. ISHELL_ForceExit() is identical
   to ISHELL_Busy(). ISHELL_Resume() allows an application to break time-consuming
   tasks into smaller, interruptible chunks. Each chunk is represented by a callback
   function and an associated data pointer. Calling ISHELL_Resume() schedules the callback
   function to be invoked at a later time with the data pointer as its only parameter.
   Use ISHELL_CanStartApplet() or IAppletCtl_Control() to check whether it is
   possible to start a BREW application, which may not be true if higher priority
   activities are in progress on the device.
===H2>
Dialogs, message boxes, and prompts
===/H2>

   A dialog consists of a screen containing one or more BREW controls that allow the
   device user to enter data or select an item from a menu. Although you may create
   such a screen with the BREW control interfaces (IDateCtl Interface, IMenuCtl Interface,
   ITextCtl Interface and ITimeCtl Interface), IDialog Interface simplifies this task:

    -    Create a dialog using the BREW Resource Editor including specification of
   each of the controls in the dialog. See the BREW Resource Editor Guide for more
   information.

    -    The BREW AEE maintains a stack of the dialogs associated with the currently
   running application. When you create a dialog, it is placed at the top of the stack;
   when a dialog ends, it is removed from the stack and the dialog below it is restored.
   This makes it easy to implement applications that step the device user through a
   sequence of screens (such as a menu hierarchy).

    -    When a dialog is active, it receives all events and distributes them to the
   currently active controls. The dialog also handles control tabbing, which allows
   the device user to move between controls in a multicontrol dialog. This frees you
   from having to implement code to distribute and handle these events.

   Use ISHELL_CreateDialog() to create a dialog. This function accepts either the identifier
   of a dialog you have created in the BREW Resource Editor or a pointer to a data
   structure that you populate in your code to specify the controls in the dialog.
   If successful, the function shows the dialogs controls on the screen and pushes
   it onto the dialog stack. To end the dialog, you call ISHELL_EndDialog(), which
   terminates the dialog at the top of the stack and shows the dialog immediately below
   it on the stack. This function also sends the EVT_DIALOG_END event to your application,
   which allows you to perform any processing associated with the dialogs termination,
   such as retrieving values entered by the device user in the dialogs controls. ISHELL_EndDialog()
   also frees all the resources that are being used by the dialog.

   ISHELL_CreateDialog() does not return an interface pointer to the dialog it creates.
   ISHELL_GetActiveDialog() is used to obtain an IDialog Interface pointer for the
   dialog at the top of the stack. Use this pointer to invoke the functions that comprise
   the IDialog Interface: IDIALOG_GetControl(), which returns interface pointers to
   any of the dialogs controls, and IDIALOG_SetFocus(), which is used to specify which
   control in a multicontrol dialog receives input from the device user.

   The AEE Shell also provides functions that can be used to create simple, commonly
   used dialogs with a single function call. ISHELL_Prompt() shows a dialog with a
   Soft Key control menu that prompts the device user to make a selection. When the
   device user does so, the selection is returned to your application using an EVT_COMMAND
   and the dialog is automatically terminated. There are also two functions that create
   a dialog that shows a read-only text message and title. ISHELL_MessageBox() reads
   the title and message text from a BREW resource file, while ISHELL_MessageBoxText()
   accepts pointers to title and message text strings that you specify in your code.
   The dialogs created by these functions end when the device user presses a key.
===H2>
Device and application configuration information
===/H2>

   These functions allow configuration information about the device and specific applications
   to be obtained. ISHELL_GetDeviceInfo() returns a pointer to an AEEDeviceInfo structure
   for the device, which includes information about its screen size and color support,
   amount of available memory, character encoding, and other items.

   ISHELL_GetPrefs() and ISHELL_SetPrefs() provide a general-purpose mechanism for
   applications to register configuration information. Use ISHELL_SetPrefs() to associate
   a pointer to configuration data and a version number for this data with the ClassID
   of your application. Other applications can obtain this data by calling ISHELL_GetPrefs()
   with the specified ClassID and version number. You also must provide a structure
   declaration that defines the content of each version of your applications configuration
   data.
===H2>
Miscellaneous
===/H2>

   ISHELL_Beep() allows an application to provide several types of audible or vibrating
   signals to the device user. Depending on what a given device supports, there are
   audible signals that correspond to device-off, alert, reminder, message arrival
   and error events, and vibrating signals for alerts and reminders. There is also
   a Boolean loudness parameter that can be specified.
===H2>
Notifications
===/H2>

   IShells notification mechanism allows a BREW class to notify other classes that
   certain events have occurred. A class activated to receive a notification must register
   its interest with the AEE Shell specifying the ClassID of the notifier class and
   the events for which notification is specified. When an event requiring notification
   occurs, the notifier class calls ISHELL_Notify(), which sends notification to each
   class that has registered to be notified of the occurrence of that event.

   The AEE Shell provides two ways for a class to register for notification of an event:

    -    Register by specifying information about the notification in your applications
   MIF file using the MIF Editor. This method of registering is used by applications
   that must be notified of events even when they are not running. One example is a
   call-logging application that receives notification of each incoming and outgoing
   call. Such an application needs to process notifications even while the device user
   is not running the application to display the call log.

    -    If notification is required only at certain times while your application is
   running, call ISHELL_RegisterNotify() to initiate event notification. For example,
   a game application might display a message when an incoming call arrives that allows
   the device user to accept the call or continue playing the game. This application
   requires notification of incoming calls only while the device user is actually playing
   the game, so it calls ISHELL_RegisterNotify() when the device user starts to play
   the game.

   The events for which a notifier class provides notifications are represented by
   a 32-bit variable. The low-order 16 bits of this variable contain the notification
   mask with each bit corresponding to one event. The high-order 16 bits contain the
   notifier match value, which can be used for data associated with an event. For example,
   events representing activity on a UDP socket use the match value for the port on
   which the activity has occurred. When it registers for notification, a class provides
   a value for the mask variable with the bit for each event of interest set to 1.
   If a class no longer requires notification of an event, it can call ISHELL_RegisterNotify()
   with that events bit set to 0 (zero) in the mask variable. For example, an application
   might call ISHELL_RegisterNotify() with the mask variable set to 0 (zero) upon termination.

   NOTE: The AEE Shell creates an instance of the notifier class when another class
   registers for notification of its events. This instance is released when all classes
   have unregistered for event notification.

   When a notifier class calls ISHELL_Notify(), the AEE Shell sends an event of type
   EVT_NOTIFY to each application that has registered for the event. This results in
   the invocation of the applications IAPPLET_HandleEvent() function. If the application
   is not currently running, the AEE Shell creates an instance of it to process the
   event, after which the application terminates. The application can send itself a
   start event to continue running. In the call to IAPPLET_HandleEvent(), the application
   also is passed a pointer to a structure of type AEENotify, which identifies the
   event that occurred, the class that generated the notification, and some additional
   data specific to the notification.

   At present, the INetMgr class sends notifications to other interested classes of
   changes in the network connection state and the arrival of data on particular UDP
   ports. You can also implement your own notifier classes. Your class must implement
   the INotifier Interface (see the sample notifications application for details on
   how to declare this interface when defining your class). The INotifier Interface
   requires you to implement a INOTIFIER_SetMask() function for your class. The AEE
   Shell calls this function whenever another class registers for event notification
   from your class. INOTIFIER_SetMask() has a single argument, which is a 32-bit variable
   that is the logical OR of the mask variables that each class used when it registered
   for notifications from your class. This variable has a value of 1 for a bit if at
   least one class has registered for notification of the corresponding event. You
   can use this variable to perform any initialization needed when a class first registers
   to be notified of an event, and any finalization when there are no longer any classes
   requiring notification of a particular event.
===H2>
   To provide notifier functionality in your class
===/H2>

   1.   Provide an include file that contains constants defining the bits assigned
   to each notification event, and typedefs for the event-specific data that is provided
   as part of an event notification. This include file is used by applications that
   register for notifications from your class.

   2.   Call ISHELL_Notify() whenever a notification event occurs and at least one
   class has registered to be notified of that events occurrence.
===H2>
   Resource files and file handlers
===/H2>

   The AEE Shell provides a number of functions that your application can use to read
   various types of data from files. These files can be BREW resource (.bar) files
   created with the BREW Resource Editor, or they can be files whose content is associated
   with a MIME type or identified by the files extension. You can also extend the
   set of file types that the BREW AEE recognizes by defining your own handler classes
   and using them to manipulate files of particular MIME types.

   Use the following functions to access BREW resource files. Each functions parameters
   include the name of the resource file and the integer resource ID:

    -    ISHELL_LoadResData() loads resources other than strings and bitmap images.
   At present, these include several resource types associated with dialogs. The memory
   used to store the resource information is freed by calling ISHELL_FreeResData().

    -    ISHELL_LoadResImage() loads a bitmap image from a specified resource file
   and returns a pointer to an instance of the IImage Interface that contains the bitmap.
   IIMAGE_Release() frees the data used to store the bitmap.

    -    ISHELL_LoadResObject() implements the sound and image loading functions. ISHELL_LoadImage(),
   ISHELL_LoadResImage(), ISHELL_LoadSound(), and ISHELL_LoadResSound() are all macros
   that invoke this function with different parameters.

    -    ISHELL_LoadResSound() loads a sound resource from the specified resource file
   and returns a pointer to an instance of the ISoundPlayer Interface that contains
   the sound file. ISOUNDPLAYER_Release() frees the data used to store the sound data.

    -    ISHELL_LoadResString() reads a string resource into a character buffer, a
   pointer to which is one of the functions arguments.

   ISHELL_LoadImage() and ISHELL_LoadSound() can be used to load image and sound files
   directly without first placing their contents into a BREW resource file. The files
   must contain one of the built-in MIME types supported by the BREW AEE, which include
   Windows bitmap (BMP) or a device-specific native bitmap format for images and MIDI
   (.mid) or CMX (.pdm) sound files.

   Use ISHELL_RegisterHandler() to associate a MIME file type with the ClassID of the
   BREW handler class you have implemented to handle files of that type. ISHELL_GetHandler()
   returns the ClassID of the handler class associated with a given MIME type, including
   the BREW built-in types mentioned above.

   Call ISHELL_GetHandler() to get the ClassID of the handler class for the files
   MIME type.

   Call ISHELL_CreateInstance() to create an instance of the handler class.
===H2>
Timers
===/H2>

   The AEE Shells timer is used by a currently instantiated application (an application
   whose reference count is non-zero) to perform an action when a specified amount
   of time has passed. These time periods are typically short (seconds or milliseconds).
   Use the AEE Shells alarm functions to obtain notification when longer time periods
   have passed, even when your application is not currently instantiated.

   To start a timer, you call ISHELL_SetTimer() and specify the timer duration in milliseconds,
   the address of a callback function, and a pointer to an application-specific data
   structure. When the timer expires, the AEE Shell calls the callback function with
   the application-specific data pointer as its only parameter. BREW timers are one-time,
   nonrecurring timers, so it is not possible to specify a timer that repeats at a
   fixed interval. However, to obtain this behavior, call ISHELL_SetTimer() within
   your callback function and specify the functions own address as ISHELL_SetTimer()s
   callback function parameter.

   ISHELL_GetTimerExpiration() can be used to determine the number of milliseconds
   remaining before a particular timer expires. A timer is identified by the callback
   function and data structure addresses supplied when it was created. ISHELL_CancelTimer()
   cancels a running timer. If a NULL value is supplied for the callback function parameter,
   all timers associated with the specified data structure address are canceled. When
   an application instances reference count drops to 0 (zero), all timers associated
   with that application are canceled.

ISHELL_QueryClass()

Description:
   This function queries the AEE Shell to determine if the specified class or applet
   is supported. If the AEEAppInfo data structure pointer is provided, AEE Shell assumes
   that the requested class is an applet. In that case, the structure is filled if
   the requested applet class was found. If the class is supported but is not an applet,
   the function returns FALSE. If the AEEAppInfo pointer is not passed, the AEE Shell
   assumes the request is made to check the availability of the class, regardless of
   whether it is an applet. This function also checks if the requester has the required
   privilege to create the requested class. If the requester does not have the right
   privilege, this function returns FALSE even if the class is actually available in
   the system.

ISHELL_StartApplet()

Description:
   This function instructs the AEE Shell to start the applet associated with the
   specified 32-bit ClassID. If the requested class is supported and can be started,
   the AEE Shell loads and starts the applet. This call returns immediately to the
   caller before starting the applet.

   The applet is started asynchronously, so if the applet classID being specified
   is not found, the function returns TRUE but the applet is not started. Asynchronous
   applet start success or failure is notified to applications registered with IShell
   with NMASK_SHELL_START_STATUS mask. When the applet is started or when it is resumed, 
   the display is cleared (if the AFLAG_POPUP flag is not set) and the IAPPLET_HandleEvent() 
   is sent the EVT_APP_START or EVT_APP_RESUME event along with the AEEAppStart parameter 
   block. If an applet is started by another applet, the currently active applet is 
   suspended.

   Please note the following:

   - ISHELL_StartApplet is an asynchronous function.  The new applet
   will not be started until control is released to the system.

   - ISHELL_StartApplet will cause the current applet to receive an EVT_APP_SUSPEND
   event immediately before the new application is started.

   - If an applet has failed to exit properly the last time it ran, the return
   code of EBADSHUTDOWN will be returned by ISHELL_StartApplet.
   
   - If the applet being started is the screen saver app (SSA_SSAVER flag is set) the 
   top visible app will be sent EVT_APP_NO_CLOSE(EVT_BUSY) event. If the SSA_SSAVER flag
   of the applet being started is not set the top visible app will NOT be sent 
   EVT_APP_NO_CLOSE(EVT_BUSY).

=======================================================================

Function: ISHELL_StartAppletEx()

Description:
   This method instructs the AEE to start the applet associated
   with the specified 32-bit class ID using the flags specified.  This
   call behaves identically to the ISHELL_StartApplet function with the
   following differences:

   1)  If the SSA_NO_VOICE_CALL flag is specified, the applet will not
   be started during a voice call.

   2)  If the SSA_AFTER_VOICE_CALL flag is specified, the applet will
   be started after the current voice call ends and any OEM-defined call
   ended dialogs are dismissed.

   3)  If the SSA_CONFIG flag is called, the applet is started with the
   EVT_APP_CONFIG event.

   4)  If the SSA_HIDDEN_CONFIG flag is specified, the applet is started with
   the EVT_APP_HIDDEN_CONFIG event.

   5)  If the SSA_BACKGROUND flag is specified, the applet is started
   in the background. This flag cannot be specified on an application that
   is already in the app-history. Doing so will return ENOTALLOWED.

   6)  If the SSA_SSAVER flag is specified, the applet is started
   in screen saver mode.

   7)  If the SSA_UNIQUE flag is specified, the applet is started
   with new/unique instance.

   Note that if neither the SSA_CONFIG or SSA_HIDDEN_CONFIG flags are
   specified, the app is started with the standard EVT_APP_START event.

Prototype:

   int ISHELL_StartAppletEx(IShell *po, AEECLSID cls,uint16 wFlags);

Parameters:
   po: Pointer to the IShell object
   cls: 32-bit applet class ID
   wFlags:  Behavior flags (SSA_XXXX)

Return Value:
   SUCCESS: if Applet created and started
   EALREADY: if Another applet is already starting
   EBADCLASS: if Shell class supplied invalid
   ENOMEMORY: if Insufficient memory
   ECLASSNOTSUPPORT: if Class specified is not supported
   EEXPIRED: if Applet has expired
   EITEMBUSY: If current top visible application will not release control
   EFILENOEXISTS: if The applet has been disabled
   EUNABLETOLOAD: if OEM or current app won't allow loading this applet
   ENOTALLOWED: if the flag SSA_BACKGROUND is passed to start an applet that
   is already in the app-history
   AEE_STREAM_WOULDBLOCK: if the flag SSA_AFTER_VOICE_CALL is specified and
   thus application start is deferred because of ongoing voice call

ISHELL_StartAppletArgs()

Description:
   This method allows passing command line arguments to a BREW application when
   it is started. This method instructs the AEE to start the applet associated with
   the specified 32-bit class ID, passing it the arguments. If the requested class
   is supported and can be started, the AEE loads and starts the applet. Note that
   this call returns immediately to the caller before starting the applet. The applet
   is started asynchronously. Hence, if the applet class ID being specified is not
   found, this function will still return TRUE but the applet will not be started.

   When the applet is started or when it is resumed the display is cleared 
   (if the AFLAG_POPUP flag is not set) and the ISHELL_HandleEvent() is sent the 
   EVT_APP_START or EVT_APP_RESUME along with the AEEAppStart parameter block.

   NOTE:
   ISHELL_StartApplet() is an asynchronous function. The new applet is not started
   until control is released to the system.

   -    ISHELL_StartApplet() causes the current applet to receive an EVT_APP_SUSPEND
        event immediately before the new application is started.
   -    Start arguments are passed as a character string in the AEEAppStart block.
        The application may also receive an EVT_APP_BROWSE_FILE or EVT_APP_BROWSE_URL
        if the arguments are non-NULL.

   Applications that do not handle the EVT_APP_SUSPEND command, do not receive
   the argument block upon subsequent EVT_APP_START notifications when the application
   is restarted as part of the resume process.

Prototype:
    int ISHELL_StartAppletArgs
    (
    IShell *pIShell,

Parameters:
    pIShell :  Pointer to the IShell object
    cls :  32-bit applet class ID
    pszArgs :  ASCIIZ string of arguments to the application.

Return Value:

ISHELL_StartBackgroundApplet()

Description:
   This method is identical to ISHELL_StartAppletArgs with the exception
   that the specified application is started in the background. In this case, the 
   app receives the EVT_APP_START_BACKGROUND event instead of the EVT_APP_START event.
   Calling this function on an application that has already started and is currently in the 
   app-history will fail and  return ENOTALLOWED

Description:
   This method instructs the AEE to start the applet associated with the

=======================================================================

Function: ISHELL_PostURL()

Description:
   This function posts an asynchronous event, EVT_APP_POST_URL, to the 
   applet associated with the URL's scheme.  BREW will make a copy of 
   the URL before passing it to the application handling the event.
   Unlike ISHELL_BrowseURL, this function will not cause the app to 
   become top-visible. This function works similar to ISHELL_PostEvent(). 
   This means:
   a. If the application is already loaded, the event EVT_APP_POST_URL 
      will be sent to it
   b. If the application is not currently loaded, the app will be loaded 
      and the event EVT_APP_POST_URL will be sent to it.  The application 
      will not be automatically made top-visible.  On receiving this event, 
      if the app desires to become top-visible, it needs to call 
      ISHELL_StartApplet() on itself.  On receiving this event, if the app 
      desires to stay in the background even after handling this event, it 
      needs to call ISHELL_StartBackgroundApplet on itself.

Prototype:
   boolean ISHELL_PostURL(IShell *po, const char * pszURL);

Parameters:
   po: Pointer to the IShell object
   pszURL: Pointer to the URL

Return Value:
    TRUE: if the event was posted. The return status only indicates whether the
event was successfully placed in the queue. It does not indicate that the event
was successfully sent to the receiving applet.
    FALSE: if the event was not posted.

Function: ISHELL_SendURL()

Description:
   This function posts a synchronous event, EVT_APP_POST_URL, to the 
   applet associated with the URL's scheme.  BREW will make a copy of 
   the URL before passing it to the application handling the event.
   Unlike ISHELL_BrowseURL, this function will not cause the app to 
   become top-visible. This function works similar to ISHELL_SendEvent(). 
   This means:
   a. If the application is already loaded, the event EVT_APP_POST_URL 
      will be sent to it
   b. If the application is not currently loaded, the app will be loaded 
      and the event EVT_APP_POST_URL will be sent to it.  The application 
      will not be automatically made top-visible.  On receiving this event, 
      if the app desires to become top-visible, it needs to call 
      ISHELL_StartApplet() on itself.  On receiving this event, if the app 
      desires to stay in the background even after handling this event, it

ISHELL_CloseApplet()

Description:
   This function instructs the AEE Shell to close the active applet. The applet
   is sent the EVT_APP_STOP message and IAPPLET_Release() is called. The bReturnToIdle
   parameter indicates whether the AEE must close all other active applications and
   return the idle screen.

Prototype:
    int ISHELL_CloseApplet(IShell * pIShell, boolean bReturnToIdle)

Parameters:
    pIShell : Pointer to the IShell Interface object.
    bReturnToIdle : This parameter indicates whether BREW must close
                    all active applications and return to the idle screen.
                    If FALSE, only the currently running applet is closed.
                    If TRUE, all applications having a history entry are closed 
                    (background applications don't have history entries). 
                    PL_SYSTEM is required to call this function with bReturnToIdle 
                    set to TRUE.

Return Value:
    SUCCESS: operation was successful.
    EFAILED: operation failed.
    EPRIVLEVEL: if caller does not have sufficient priv level to call with bReturnToIdle
                set to TRUE

ISHELL_CanStartApplet()

Description:
   This function queries the AEE Shell to determine whether it is safe to start
   an applet. Under normal conditions, this call returns TRUE. However, in some cases,
   new applet startup may be prevented when critical dialogs are displayed or other
   applets are running. This function does NOT send EVT_APP_NO_CLOSE event to the
   top visible app.

ISHELL_SetTimer()

Description:
   This method allows the caller to set a short-term timer. Upon expiration, the
   specified callback function is called, passing it the specified user data pointer
   as its first argument. Note the following:
     -    Timer will expire at Current Time + <Milliseconds specified>
     -    Timer callbacks are made in the application's task state. The system shields
          the application developer from managing non-task callbacks.
     -    Any normal processing can be done in the callback. This includes drawing
          to the screen, writing to files, etc.
     -    Timers do not repeat. The user must reset the timer if they desire a repeating
          timer.
     -    Specifying the same callback/data pointers will automatically override
          a pending timer with the same callback/data pointers.
     -    Upon termination of the currently active applet, the shell scans the timer
          list. If the terminated applet was deleted as a result of its termination (ie.
          its reference count went to 0), and an associated timer was found with the data
          pointer pointing to the IApplet, the timer is deleted.
     -    Negative timeout values are treated the same as 0 timeout values

Prototype:
    int ISHELL_SetTimer
    (
    IShell * pIShell,
    int32 dwMSecs,
    PFNNOTIFY pfn,
    void * pUser
    )

Parameters:
    pIShell : Pointer to the IShell Interface object.
    dwMSecs : Timer expiration in milliseconds. The expiration occurs at Current Time +dwMSecs.  Negative values are treated as 0.
    pfn : The user callback that is called when the timer expires.
    pUser : The user data pointer that is passed as the only parameter to the callback.

Return Value:
    SUCCESS: timer successfully set.
    EBADPARM: invalid parameter.
    ENOMEMORY: not enough memory left on heap to create timer.

ISHELL_SetTimerEx()

Description:
    This method allows the caller to set a short-term timer. Upon expiration, the
specified callback function, in AEECallback, is called with the user data (also
specified in AEECallback).
    Note: The timer will expire at Current Time + <Milliseconds specified> Timer
callbacks are made in the application's task state. The system shields the application
developer from managing non-task callbacks.
    Any normal processing can be done in the callback. This includes drawing to
the screen, writing to files, etc.
    Timers do not repeat. The user must reset the timer if they desire a repeating
timer.
    Specifying the same callback/data pointers will automatically override a pending
timer with the same callback/data pointers.
    Upon termination of the currently active applet, the shell scans the timer list.
If the terminated applet was deleted as a result of its termination. For example,
its reference count went to 0), and an associated timer was found with the data
pointer pointing to the IApplet, the timer is deleted.
    Negative timeout values are treated the same as 0 timeout values

Prototype:
    int ISHELL_SetTimerEx
    (
    IShell * pIShell,
    int32 dwMSecs,
    AEECallback * pcb

Parameters:
    pIShell :  Pointer to the IShell object
    dwMSecs :  Timer expiration in milliseconds. The expiration occurs at Current Time +dwMSecs.  Negative values are treated as 0.
    pcb :  AEECallback structure allocated by user

Return Value:
    SUCCESS: timer successfully set.
    EBADPARM: invalid parameter.
    ENOMEMORY: not enough memory left on heap to create timer.

Comments:
    Preferably, use this method rather than ISHELL_SetTimer() and ISHELL_CancelTimer().
    You cancel the timer by canceling the callback: CALLBACK_Cancel(pcb).

ISHELL_GetJulianDate()

Description:
   This function fills a JulianType data structure based on the input second value.
   This value represents the number of seconds since January 6 1980 00:00:00 GMT, the
   device reference time. If the input value is 0 (zero), the current system time is
   returned.

Prototype:
    void ISHELL_GetJulianDate
    (
    IShell * pIShell,
    uint32 dwSecs,
    JulianType * pDate
    )

Parameters:
    pIShell  :  Pointer to the IShell Interface object.
    dwSecs  :  Seconds since January 6 1980, the device reference time.
    pDate  :  Pointer to the structure that needs to be filled on return.

Return Value:
    None

Comments:
    In Windows, the upper limit for dwSecs is the difference between the maximum
value allowed by the uint32, and the difference between device reference time January
6, 1980 00:00:00 GMT and PC reference time January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT.

ISHELL_CreateDialog()

Description:
   This function instructs the AEE Shell to start a dialog associate with the input
   DialogInfo data structure or the dialog information in the associated resource file.
   This call causes the AEE Shell to create a IDialog Interface. The interface processes
   the dialog input parameters to create all associated controls and other items. The
   dialog is placed at the top of the active dialog stack.

   During creation, execution, and termination, the IDialog Interface sends a number
   of dialog-related AEEEvent items (such as EVT_DIALOG_INIT, EVT_DIALOG_START, and EVT_DIALOG_END)
   to the active applet. This allows the applet to control the initial contents of
   controls, manage control changes, and retrieve the contents of controls at termination.
   The applet can obtain pointers to the underlying dialog controls by calling IDIALOG_GetControl().

Prototype:
    int ISHELL_CreateDialog
    (
    IShell * pIShell,
    const char * pszResFile,
    uint16 wID,
    DialogInfo * pInfo
    )

Parameters:
    pIShell : Pointer to the IShell Interface object.
    pszResFile : Pointer to the resource file containing the dialog information.
    wID : ID of the dialog inside the resource file.
    pInfo : Dialog information structure. 

Return Value:
    SUCCESS: if successful.
    ENOMEMORY: insufficient memory.
    EBADPARM: invalid parameter.
    EFAILED: if unsuccessful.

ISHELL_LoadResObject()

Description:
    This function loads the specified resource and creates a handler that can be
used on the resource data. The type of handler created is indicated by hType.

Prototype:
    IBase * ISHELL_LoadResObject
    (
    IShell * pIShell,
    const char * pszResFile,
    int16 nResID,
    AEEHandlerType hType
    )

Parameters:
    pIShell : Pointer to the IShell Interface object.
    pszResFile : Resource file containing the specified resource.
    nResID : ID of the resource in the resource file.
    hType : Type of handler that must be created and associated with the resource data.

    The interface pointer returned from this function depends on the specified handler
    type. The AEEHandlerType must coincide with the actual type of the resource data.


Return Value:
    Pointer to handle the resource data, if successful.
    NULL: if unsuccessful.

Comments:
    For example:
    If the resource data is of type HTYPE_SOUND and if hType parameter is set to
HTYPE_VIEWER, the behavior of this function is unpredictable.
    If hType is HTYPE_VIEWER, it indicates that the resource data is a bitmap resource.
This function creates an IImage Interface and associates the resource data with
it. The IImage Interface pointer is then returned from this function. This interface
pointer can be used to view the image.
    If hType is HTYPE_SOUND, it indicates that the resource data is a sound stream.
In this case, this function creates and returns a ISoundPlayer Interface pointer
that can then be used to play the sound.
    ISHELL_LoadResImage() and ISHELL_LoadResSound() are specific usages of this
function with the hType set to HTYPE_VIEWER and HTYPE_SOUND, respectively.

ISHELL_LoadResData()

Description:
   This function returns a void * data block associated with the specified resource
file, ID, and type. The memory returned must be freed using ISHELL_FreeResData().

Prototype:
    void * ISHELL_LoadResData
    (
    IShell * pIShell,
    const char * pszResFile,
    int16 nResID,
    ResType nType
    )

Parameters:
    pIShell : Pointer to the IShell Interface object.
    pszResFile : Resource file containing the data.
    nResID : ID of the data in the resource file.
    nType : The type of resource:~
~
            RESTYPE_IMAGE, ~
            RESTYPE_DIALOG,~
            RESTYPE_CONTROL, ~
            RESTYPE_ LISTITEM, (currently not supported)~
            RESTYPE_BINARY, ~
*
    If nType is RESTYPE_IMAGE, the first byte indicates the offset where the
    actual image data begins, and the second byte is 0 (zero). Starting from
    the third byte, the string indicates the MIME type followed by the actual
    image data.

Return Value:
    A void pointer, pointing to the resource data, if successful.
    NULL: if otherwise.

Comments:
    This function loads the *raw* contents of the resource.  Any parsing

ISHELL_LoadResDataEx()

Description:
    This function attempts to load the resource specified by type and ID from the
    specified resource context. The function either allocates memory or loads into a
    pre-allocated buffer. If the function allocates memory, it must be freed with
    ISHELL_FreeResData().

Prototype:
    void *ISHELL_LoadResDataEx
    (
    IShell * pIShell,
    const char * pszResFile,
    uint16 nResID,
    ResType nType,
    void * pBuf,
    uint32 * pnBufSize
    )

Parameters:
    pIShell :  Pointer to the IShell object.
    pszResFile :  Resource file containing the data.
    nResID :  ID of the data in the resource file.
    nType :  The type of resource:~
~
             RESTYPE_STRING, ~
             RESTYPE_IMAGE, ~
             RESTYPE_DIALOG, ~

             RESTYPE_LISTITEM, (currently not supported)~
             RESTYPE_BINARY, ~
*
    pBuf :  Buffer into which to load the resource data.
            If pBuf is NULL, a buffer is allocated to hold the loaded resource, and must
            be freed with ISHELL_FreeResData().
            If pBuf is -1, no buffer is allocated, but size information is calculated and
            returned in pnBufSize.
    pnBufSize :  Cannot be NULL.
               [in] if pBuf is not NULL or -1. INPUT Points to the sizeof(pBuf) in bytes.
					If pBuf is NULL or -1, pnBufSize is ignored on INPUT.
			   [out] Contains the size of the resource data read.
					If pBuf was not NULL on INPUT and *pnBufSize was too small to hold
					the resource, the function returns NULL. If pBuf was -1, pnBufSize 
					is filled with the actual resource size, the function returns -1 (0xffffffff).

Return Value:
    void pointer to the resource data, if successful.
    NULL: if loading resource fails or buffer size is too small to hold the resource.

Comments:
    This function loads the *raw* contents of the resource. Any parsing or interpretation
of the data is up to the application to perform.
    If loading a string resource, the contents of pBuf (and the returned void *)
is the bytes of the string without NULL termation.
    If loading an image resource, the contents of pBuf is an AEEResBlob structure,
whose raw data lies at RESBLOB_DATA(pBuf).

ISHELL_SendEvent()

Description:
    The entire execution model of the AEE is based on a semi-cooperative
    event-passing model. Under this model, events are sent to the active
    dialog or applet using ISHELL_SendEvent(), which allows for control
    over the destination applet. This function sends the event directly
    to the destination applet. Events can be sent to a specific applet by
    specifying the destination applet. If the applet is not currently
    running, it is loaded and the event is sent directly to it. Under
    these conditions, the applet is started in the background (EVT_APP_START
    and EVT_APP_STOP events are not sent to the applet). Private events can
    be sent to an applet by defining the event at or above EVT_USER, and
    specifying the applet ClassID. An error is returned if events in the
    range of EVT_USER and above are sent without an associated ClassID.
    If a dialog is active through ISHELL_CreateDialog(), the event is
    passed to the dialog before being passed to the applet. The event is
    passed to the applet only if the dialog did not process the event.
    The wp and dwp parameters associated with the event are specific to the
    event. The AEE Shell does not examine these values.

Prototype:
    boolean ISHELL_SendEvent
    (
    IShell * pIShell,
    AEECLSID clsApp,
    AEEEvent evt,
    uint16 wp,

Parameters:
    pIShell : Pointer to the IShell Interface object.
    clsApp :  Class of the applet for the event. This parameter is required for
               events in the range of EVT_USER and above.
    evt : AEEEvent items.
    wp : Event-specific 16-bit value.
    dwp : Event-specific 32-bit value.

ISHELL_PostEvent()

Description:
    This function posts an asynchronous event to the specified applet.
    The function is similar to ISHELL_SendEvent(). The main difference is
    that this function posts the event to the applet, and ISHELL_SendEvent()
    immediately sends the event to the applet. Event posting is provided for
    special cases where the caller either posts an event from another task or
    defers the processing of the event until the next iteration of the event
    loop. This is useful in providing continued execution while allowing other
    events to be processed. Private events can be sent to an applet by defining
    the event at or above EVT_USER level, and specifying the applet ClassID. An
    error is returned if events in the range of EVT_USER and above are sent
    without an associated ClassID.

Prototype:
    boolean ISHELL_PostEvent
    (
    IShell * pIShell,
    AEECLSID clsApp,
    AEEEvent evt,
    uint16 wp,
    uint32 dwp
    )

Parameters:
    pIShell  :  Pointer to the IShell Interface object.
    clsApp  :  ClassID of the applet for the event. This parameter is required and
               must denote an applet. If the clsApp specified here does not belong
               to an applet, this function may still return TRUE, but the actual
               sending of the event fails when the event is popped out of the queue
               and an attempt is made to send to the applet specified by clsApp.
    evt  :  AEEEvent items.
    wp  :  Event-specific 16-bit value.
    dwp  :  Event-specific 32-bit value.

Return Value:
    TRUE: if the event was posted. The return status only indicates whether the
event was successfully placed in the queue. It does not indicate that the event
was successfully sent to the receiving applet.
    FALSE: if the event was not posted.

Comments:
    This function doesn't allow multiple events of the same type (same event code) 
    to be posted and pending to be dispatched for the same app. Aforementioned
    capability is provided by ISHELL_PostEventEx().
    
    On application closure after delivery of EVT_APP_STOP, events pending for posting
    to the application are canceled and thus such events are not delivered to the
    application.

ISHELL_PostEventEx()

Description:
    This function posts an asynchronous event to the specified app. This function
is very similar to ISHELL_PostEvent(). The main difference is that this function
allows multiple events of the same type (same event code) to be posted and pending
to be dispatched for the same app. Private events can be sent to an applet by defining
the event at or above EVT_USER and specifying the applet class. An error is returned
if events in the range of EVT_USER and above are sent without an associated class
ID.

Prototype:
    boolean ISHELL_PostEventEx
    (IShell * pIShell,
    uint16 wFlags,
    AEECLSID clsApp,
    AEEEvent evt,
    uint16 wp,
    uint32 dwp
    );

Parameters:
    pIShell :  Pointer to the IShell object
    wFlags :  Flags to specify how the event must be posted. If no flags are used,
              this parameter is set to 0. The typical usage is to set this value to 0.
              The supported flags are
               EVTFLG_UNIQUE - This flag indicates that only one of this event type can
               be pending at any time. If this flag is set, there cannot be multiple
               events of the same event codepending for an app. To allow posting of
               multiple events of the same event code,this flag must not be set.
               Setting this flag causes this function to work justlike ISHELL_PostEvent().
    clsApp :  Class of the applet for the event. This parameter is required for
              events in the range of EVT_USER and above. This must denote an applet.
              It cannot be an ordinary class.
    evt :  Event type (EVT_XXXX)
    wp :  Event-specific 16-bit value
    dwp :  Event-specific 32-bit value

Return Value:
    TRUE: if the event was posted. The return status only indicates whether or not
the eventwas successfully placed in the queue. It does not indicate that the event
wassuccessfully sent to the receiving classID. If the clsID specified here does
not belongto an applet, this function may still return TRUE but the actual sending
of the eventwill fail when the event is popped out of the queue and an attempt is
made to send to thegiven classID.
    FALSE: if the event was not posted

Comments:
    On application closure after delivery of EVT_APP_STOP, events pending for posting
    to the application are canceled and thus such events are not delivered to the
    application.

ISHELL_HandleEvent()

Description:
    This function sends one of the specified standard AEEEvent items to the currently
active applet. It internally invokes ISHELL_SendEvent() with ClassID set to 0 (zero).
This function can only send events in the range: EVT_COMMAND to EVT_USER. It cannot
send events equal to or above EVT_USER. This function is meant to be used only by
user-implemented controls. For example, if a control wants to send the event EVT_CTL_TAB
to the currently active application, it can use this function. Applications must
generally use the function ISHELL_SendEvent() or ISHELL_PostEvent() to send events
to themselves or to other specific applications.

Prototype:
    boolean ISHELL_HandleEvent
    (
    IShell * pIShell,
    AEEEvent evt,
    uint16 wp,

Parameters:
    pIShell  :  Pointer to the IShell Interface object.
    evt  :  AEEEvent items.
    wp  :  Event-specific 16-bit value.
    dwp  :  Event-specific 32-bit value.

Return Value:
    TRUE: if the event was processed.
    FALSE: if the event was not processed.

Comments:
    The event sent must be one of the standard AEEEvent items. For example, it must
be < EVT_USER; it cannot be an EVT_USER event.

Use ISHELL_PostEvent() to send user events.

Parameters:
    pIShell  :  Pointer to the IShell Interface object.
    nBeep  :  Type of beep to play.
    bLoud  :  TRUE if the beep can be played at a higher volume.

Return Value:
    TRUE: if the beep was played.
    FALSE: if the beep was not played.

Comments:
    In the BREW Simulator, users can define their own beep type tones in WAV format.
The beep types correspond to BeepType enumeration, which is required in ISHELL_Beep().
The tones are saved in the <$BREWDIR\bin\DataFiles> directory. For example, to create
your own BEEP_ALERT tone, save your WAV file as BEEP_ALERT.wav.

    BREW SDK is shipped with tone files for all beep types. ISHELL_Beep() is illustrated
in the sample Sound applet.

ISHELL_Prompt()

Description:
    This function provides a mechanism for an application to display a multi selection
prompt. The text can be specified from a resource file or directly passed in the
AEEPromptInfo data structure. The AEE Shell first examines the text pointers before
attempting to load the text from the resource file. The buttons are specified by
the values in the AEEPromptInfo->pBtnIDs list. For convenience, it is assumed that
the IDs for the buttons are associated with both the text and command ID for the
button. If the passed button pointer is NULL, the prompt must successfully be displayed
without any button. The prompt dialog is automatically dismissed when the device
user selects a button or presses the CLR key. In this case, the EVT_COMMAND message
is sent to the application with the 16-bit extra parameter indicating the ID of
the selection.

Prototype:
    boolean ISHELL_Prompt(IShell * pIShell, AEEPromptInfo * pi)

Parameters:
    pIShell  :  Pointer to the IShell Interface object.
    pi  :  Pointer to the AEEPromptInfo data structure.

Return Value:
    TRUE: if the prompt is created.
    FALSE: if the prompt is not created.

Comments:

    uint16 wTextID
    )

Parameters:
    pIShell : Pointer to the IShell Interface object.
    pszResFile : Resource file containing the title and text. If this is NULL,
                 the resource ID of the text (such as wTextID) is used to retrieve
                 an error message from the BREW resource file (AEEControls.bar)
                 located in the language directory (for example, "en" for English).
                 This error message is then displayed in the message box.
    wTitleID : ID of the title, which can be a maximum size of 128 bytes (64 UNICODE
               (UCS2 encoding) characters).
    wTextID : ID of the text, which can be a maximum size of 256 bytes (128 UNICODE
              (UCS2 encoding) characters).

Return Value:
    TRUE: if the message box was created.
    FALSE: otherwise.

Comments:
    If either the title or text exceeds the maximum limit, the message box will
    not be created.

ISHELL_SetAlarm()

Description:
    This function allows the caller to set a long-term alarm for an applet. When
the alarm expires, the applet is loaded and passed an EVT_ALARM event with the specified
16-bit nUserCode as the user parameter. If the applet is not active at the time
of the alarm, it is loaded but is not sent an EVT_APP_START event. If the applet
is to be activated, it must call ISHELL_StartApplet(). More than one alarm can be
set for an applet by specifying a different 16-bit alarm nUserCode.

ISHELL_GetHandler()

Description:
    This function provides query access to the AEE Shells database of registered
content viewers and protocol scheme handlers. This database allows browsers and
content viewers to expose handlers for content or data protocols they may support.
    The AEEHandlerType data structure indicates whether the input string is a viewer
(such as image type) or a sound type.

Prototype:
    AEECLSID ISHELL_GetHandler
    (
    IShell * pIShell,
    AEECLSID clsBase,
    const char * pszIn

=======================================================================

ISHELL_RegisterHandler()

Description:
    This function provides a mechanism for a content viewer or protocol engine to
register itself with the AEE Shell. This allows other components to share its functionality
when content or protocol types are encountered. As the handler is specified by class,
it can be loaded dynamically on an as-needed basis. IShell allows only one handler to be
associated with a scheme. To update a handler, the existing handler must be deleted from 
the database by calling ISHELL_RegisterHandler() with a 0 (zero) ClassID.

Prototype:
    int ISHELL_RegisterHandler
    (
    IShell * pIShell,
    AEECLSID clsBase,
    const char * pszIn,
    AEECLSID cls
    )

Parameters:
    pIShell  :  Pointer to the IShell Interface object.
    clsBase  :  Handler type (HTYPE_VIEWER, HTYPE_SOUND) base class, or interface id.  
                The interface must be IQueryInterface based.
    pszIn  :  Input string. If this is NULL, EBADPARM is returned. The string contains
              a comma-delimited list of the MIME types or schemes handled by the specified
              class.
    cls  :  AEECLSID of the handler. No validation performed on this parameter.

Return Value:
    SUCCESS: operation is successful.
    EBADCLASS: invalid ClassID.
    EBADPARM: invalid parameter.
    ENOMEMORY: insufficient memory.
    EFAILED: operation failed.
    EALREADY: handler already set.

ISHELL_RegisterNotify()

Description:
    This function provides a mechanism for applets to register for notifications
that are issued from other classes. For example, an applet can register for notification
from the AEECLSID_NET interface for events specific to that class. The notification
mask indicates the type of events of interest to the caller. These bits are defined
on a per-class basis, allowing classes to define and share notifications without
requiring all such notifications to be defined by the IShell Interface.
When a notification is requested of a specific object class,
the object class is created or the reference count is
incremented. When the notification is removed (mask=0), the objects reference count
is decremented. To de-register from all notifications, invoke this function with dwMask set
to 0. Please look at documentation of dwMask below for information on how it is used.
   When an application registers for notification using its mif, RegisterNotify cannot
directly alert the application if a failure occurred.  So in the case of mif notify 
registrations, if a failure occurs the event EVT_NOTIFIER_FAILURE is sent to the 
application.  The dwParam contains a pointer to an AEENotifyFailure.

Prototype:
    int ISHELL_RegisterNotify
    (
    IShell * pIShell,
    AEECLSID clsNotify,
    AEECLSID clsType,
    uint32 dwMask
    )

Parameters:
    pIShell  :  Pointer to the IShell Interface object.
    clsNotify  :  Applet to create and notify when the event occurs. clsNotify
                  should belong to the same module as the application calling
                  ISHELL_RegisterNotify or the calling application should be running in 
                  system context.
    clsType  :  Class that issues the event. This is the Notifier class, which must
                implement the INotifier Interface functions.
    dwMask  :  Mask of events to trigger. Setting this to zero causes the caller
               to be de-registered from all notifications from the Notifier class. The mask
               is comprised of two 16 bit components. The upper 16 bits is called
               the Notify Value and the lower 16 bits is called the Notify Mask.

Return Value:
    SUCCESS: if successful.
    EBADCLASS: invalid ClassID.
    EBADPARM: invalid parameter.
    ENOMEMORY: insufficient memory.
    EFAILED: Operation Failed
    EPRIVLEVEL: Insufficient privileges to register notify from notifier

ISHELL_Notify()

Description:
    This function is called by an object when it detects an event that may be associated
with a notification requested by another class of object. For example, the INetMgr
Interface calls this function when INetMgr-related events occur. The result is that
any applets that have requested notification, whether actively loaded or not, are
sent the EVT_NOTIFY with data about the specific event. The notification mask indicates
which event occurred. The data pointer provided is specific to the mask of the event
that occurred and is defined by the class that triggered the notification. All registered
applets for a specific type of notification are called. If the applet is not currently
active, it is loaded and the event is sent to it. It is not sent the EVT_APP_START
or EVT_APP_STOP events under these conditions. If the applet is to start based on
the event, it must call ISHELL_StartApplet().

Prototype:

    (
    IShell * pIShell,
    AEECLSID clsType,

Parameters:
    pIShell  :  Pointer to the IShell Interface object.
    clsType  :  Class that issued the notification.
    dwMask  :  Mask of events in which typically only 1 bit is set for any given
               event.
    pData  :  Context sensitive data.

Return Value:
    SUCCESS: if successful.
    EBADCLASS: invalid ClassID.
    EBADPARM: invalid parameter.
    ENOMEMORY: insufficient memory.
    EREENTERED: attempt to re-enter ISHELL_Notify(). If a call to
    ISHELL_Notify() is made from within a current notification (for ex, calling
    ISHELL_Notify() from within the EVT_NOTIFY event handler of the app), this
    problem will occur.
    EBADTASK: invalid task issuing notify.

ISHELL_OnLowStorage()

Description:
    This method can be used to register for the callback to be invoked when the
system reaches low file-system space condition. This allows the application to do
file system cleanup so as to free-up more file system space for the system. The
callback is triggered if the creation of a file or directory failed due to lack of 
space on the file system or if the number of bytes which was written to a file on
a write request was less than the number of bytes specified in that write request.

Prototype:

ISHELL_Resume()

Description:
    This function allows a callback to be registered with the AEE Shell. It adds
the callback to the AEE Shell's list of pending operations. The AEE Shell invokes
the callback function the next time the event loop is called, allowing an application
or object to cooperatively multitask. If the callback has already been registered,
it is cancelled (de-registered) and then re-registered.

Prototype:
    void ISHELL_Resume(IShell * pIShell, AEECallback * pcb)

Parameters:
    pIShell  :  Pointer to the IShell Interface object.
    pcb  :  Pointer to the AEECallback structure. When the application invokes this
            function, the following members in the AEECallback structure must be set
            by the caller:
            -    pfnNotify member must be filled by the caller. This is the callback
                 function that is invoked by AEE when the event loop is called.
            -    pNotifyData must be filled by caller. This is the data that is passed
                 to the callback function.
            -    pfnCancel member must be set to NULL by the caller before registering
                 the callback for the first time. The AEE Shell fills this member with
                 the right value when this function returns.

Return Value:
    None

Comments:
    When ISHELL_Resume() is used, the AEE Shell automatically fills up some of the
data members of the AEECallback structure passed to it (for example, the members
pfnCancel and pCancelData are filled by the AEE Shell.) To cancel a callback that
has been registered, use the pfnCancel member of the AEECallback structure and pass
the pCancelData as a parameter to it.

    Example:
    Assuming that pme refers to applet struct and pme->m_cb refers to AEECallback
    structure in applet data
===pre>
    // Fill up the members of the callback structure
    pme->m_cb.pfnNotify = MyCB;    // My callback function. It must be declared
                                   // as void MyCB(void *)
    pme->m_cb.pNotifyData = pme;   // Applet Specific data
    pme->m_cb.pfnCancel = NULL;    // Initialize to NULL. It is updated by Shell

    //To register the callback do the following:
    ISHELL_Resume(pme->a.m_pIShell,&pme->m_cb);

    // To cancel the CB do the following:
    if(pme->m_cb.pfnCancel)
      pme->m_cb.pfnCancel(&pme->m_cb);

ISHELL_GetRand()
    NOTE: This function is deprecated. Use the helper function, GETRAND(), instead.

Description:
    This function leverages the random number generator on the device. It fills

Prototype:
    void ISHELL_GetRand(IShell * pIShell, byte * pDest, int nSize)

Parameters:
    pIShell :  Pointer to the IShell Interface object.
    pDest :  Destination buffer.
    nSize :  Size in bytes of the buffer.

Return Value:
    None

Comments:
    This function uses the random number generator on the device to fill an input
buffer with a series of random bytes. The sequence is seeded by the current time,
so multiple calls may give identical results unless separated by at least several
milliseconds. For best results, call it once per invocation of the event handler
function.

Description:
    This method provides access to the gpsOne location feature on the handset.
The precision specified indicates how exact the location is returned. The precision
is also directly related to the time it will take to satisfy the request. Position
Determination privileges are required to use this interface.
    NOTE: Requests for position location may be protected by the privacy policies
determined by the OEM or carrier. Upon completion, the callback is made to the user
with the position or an appropriate error.

ISHELL_CheckPrivLevel()

Description:
    This function checks the privilege level of the currently running application
against the specified value. If the privilege level matches, the function returns
TRUE. If the privilege level does not match, the function returns FALSE and conditionally
terminates the application with a system message.

Prototype:

    clsIDWant :  class to verify access for
    bQueryOnly :  If TRUE, this is a query only. If FALSE, the application terminates
if it does not have the privileges specified in wPrivWant.

Return Value:
    TRUE: application supports this privilege level mask.
    FALSE: application does not support this privilege level.

Comments:
    If bQueryOnly is FALSE and the function returns FALSE, no further processing
    is done on the application while it is terminating.

    If the high-order word of clsIDWant is 0, the value is treated as a bit-mask
    of the old-style privilege bits:~

    ISHELL_CheckPrivLevel() can be thought of as "ISHELL_AppIsInGroup".
    An application becomes a member of a "group" in one of three ways:

       1. Every application is a member of its own group: the group
          that is equal to the application's class id.

       2. Each Privilege Level set in a module's MIF denotes a group,
          PL_FILE is a group, as is PL_NETWORK.

       3. Adding a class id to the module's "Dependencies" adds the
          module to the group denoted by that class id.

    A return value of SUCCESS from ISHELL_CheckPrivLevel() does not in itself
    imply that ISHELL_CreateInstance() will succeed.  The class id desired
    may not be present on the device, may not be instantiable (e.g. PL_FILE),
    or may be restricted (Applet's class ids may only be instantiated by
    the system).

    Every application is a member of the group 0.

ISHELL_DetectType()

Description:
    Given data in a buffer or the name of an object, this function detects the MIME
type.
    This function is typically used to get the handler associated with the data
type. For example, if the data represents standard MIDI format, then this function
returns the MIME "audio/mid". Using the MIME type, you can query Shell registry
to obtain the handler (Class ID) of type AEECLSID_MEDIA.

Prototype:

    );

Parameters:
    pIShell  :  [in] :  Pointer to the IShell object
    cpBuf  :  [in] :  Buffer containing the data whose type needs to be determined
    pdwSize  :  [in/out] :  On input: Size of data in pBuf, unless pBuf is NULL,
                            then ignored
                            On output: number of additional data bytes needed to
                            perform type detection
    cpszName  :  [in] :  Name of the object whose type needs to be determined (may
                         be null, if unknown).
    pcpszMIME  :  [out] :  MIME string returned to caller, on return, filled with
                           a pointer to a constant string (do not free)

Return Value:
    SUCCESS: Data type is detected and MIME is returned
    ENOTYPE: There is no type associated with this data
    EBADPARM: Wrong input data (parameter(s))
    ENEEDMORE: Need more data to perform type detection. *pdwSize contains the required
               number of additional bytes.
    EUNSUPPORTED: Type detection for the specified input is not supported

Comments:
    pBuf takes precedence over pszName. If both of them are specified, then first
pBuf is used for type detection followed by pszName.
    If the function returns ENEEDMORE, then *pdwSize is filled with the required
additional bytes to carry out the operation. Call this function again with (original
dwSize + *pdwSize) bytes.
    To determine the maximum number of bytes required to enable type detection,
you can do the following:
===pre>
    if (ENEEDMORE == ISHELL_DetectType(ps, NULL, &dwReqSize, NULL, NULL))
    {
    // dwReqSize contains the max bytes needed for type detection
    }
===/pre>
    A typical usage: The following code creates an IMedia-based object based on
the data in the buffer and starts the media playback.
===pre>
    //--------------- BEGIN -----------------------------
    // Assume,
    // pIShell: pointer to IShell
    // pBuf: buffer containing data multimedia format (IMedia-based)
    // dwSize: size of the buffer
    //
          const char * cpszMIME;
          AEECLSID clsHandler;
          IMedia * pMedia;
    if (SUCCESS == ISHELL_DetectType(pIShell, pBuf, &dwSize, NULL, &cpszMIME)
       {
          // Query for AEECLSID_MEDIA (i.e., IMedia) type handler
          clsHandler = ISHELL_GetHandler(pIShell, AEECLSID_MEDIA,
          cpszMIME);
             if (clsHandler)
             {
                if (SUCCESS == ISHELL_CreateInstance(pIShell, clsHandler,
                (void **)&pMedia))
                   {
                   // Start using IMedia interface...
                   IMEDIA_Play(pMedia); // starts the playback
                   :

ISHELL_GetProperty

Description:
   This method retrieves the property data for the underlying
   module associated with the input class.  Note the following:

- The returned information applies to all classes owned by the specified
  module containing the specified class.

- Data is only persistent across handset resets for dynamically downloaded
  modules.

- Specifying a NULL input buffer will return the size of the data

- In the case where the client supplied buffer is not large enough, 
  the method will attempt a partial fill where possible. In this case, 
  the method shall return SUCCESS, and *pwSize will contain the buffer 
  size required for complete retrieval. 

- Properties with the high-order bit set are reserved for use by caller's
  with system-level privs.

- Specifying 0 for the input AEECLSID will assume the currently
  running application.

If getting a protected property (ex: MPROP_SID), then the caller needs to have System Privileges. 
For all other properties, the caller must belong to the same group as the class whose property is requested.
i.e. either the calling app's classID is the same as cls or the
module that contains the calling app belongs to the same groupID as cls. 
This can be done by listing cls as a dependency in the MIF of the calling app.

Prototype:

   int  ISHELL_GetProperty
   (
   IShell *po,
   AEECLSID cls,
   uint16 wID,
   void * pDest,
   uint16 * pwSize

Parameters:
   po: Pointer to the IShell object
   cls: Class of the application to query
   wID: Property ID. The supported properties are:
   MPROP_NETUSAGE,MPROP_USAGE,MPROP_STATUS

   pDest: Destination to fill
   pwSize: Pointer to size of input buffer.  Filled with data size

Return Value:

   The most likely error codes are -

   SUCCESS: the value 0 (zero)
   EBADCLASS: Input class not found
   EBUFFERTOOSMALL: Destination buffer size too small. *pwSize filled with proper size.
                    This error is only returned if a partial fill is not possible.
   EBADPARM: NULL pwSize
   EPRIVLEVEL: Caller does not have sufficient privileges

ISHELL_SetProperty

Description:
   This method sets the property data for the underlying module associated
with the input class.  Note the following:

- Properties set on non-dynamic class modules are not persistent across
handset power cycles/resets.

- Specifying a NULL input buffer will clear the property

- Properties with the high-order bit set are reserved for use by caller's
with system-level privs.

- Specifying 0 for the input AEECLSID will assume the currently
running application.

If setting a protected property (ex: MPROP_SID), then the caller needs to have System Privileges. For all other
properties, the caller must belong to the same group as the class whose property is requested.
i.e. either the calling app's classID is the same as cls or the

ISHELL_RegisterEvent()

Description:
   This method registers a custom AEEEvent based upon the input
string.  This allows applications to dynamically reserve events for
use without fear of conflict with other EVT_USER range event codes.
Note the following:

- Events are only valid between power-cycles.  The same event registered
following another power cycle will very likley return a different AEEEvent.

- 0 indicates that the event was not registered

- Previously registered events are returned with the same values.

- If supplied, the pointer to pnCount is updated with the number
of times the event was registered.

Prototype:

   AEEEvent  ISHELL_RegisterEvent
   (
   IShell *po,
   const char * pszName,

IDialog Interface

   The IDialog Interface consists of two functions that operate on dialogs created
   using the functions in the IShell Interface (refer to the description of the IShell
   interface for more details about its dialog-related functions).

   IDIALOG_GetControl() obtains interface pointers to the date, menu, text, and time
   controls that make up the dialog. Use these pointers to modify the properties and
   rectangles of the controls or to retrieve the data the device user has entered or
   selected in each control.

   IDIALOG_SetFocus() specifies which control in a multicontrol currently has the focus
   (this control receives keypad input from the device user). Many controls generate
   control tabbing events when the device user presses the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys.
   Dialogs use these control tabbing events to enable the device user to navigate between
   controls. IDIALOG_SetFocus() can be used with controls that do not support control
   tabbing (for example, Soft Key menus), or to designate the control that has focus
   initially.
===H2>
   To use IDIALOG_GetControl() and IDIALOG_SetFocus()
===/H2>

   1.   Create the controls in your dialog using the BREW Resource Editor or by populating
   the required dialog data structures in your code.

   2.   Call ISHELL_CreateDialog() to create the dialog and display it on the screen.

   3.   Call ISHELL_GetActiveDialog() to obtain an interface pointer to the
   dialog created in step 2.(The ISHELL_CreateDialog() does not return such a pointer.) 

   4.   Call IDIALOG_GetControl() to access the controls in the dialog, supplying as
   input the interface pointer obtained in step 3 and the control IDs you specified
   when you created the controls in step 1. Use this function immediately after the
   dialog has been created to customize the appearance and properties of its controls.

   5.   Call IDIALOG_SetFocus() as needed while the dialog is active to allow the device
   user to select the control in which data is to be selected or entered. For example,
   if your dialog uses a Soft Key menu, provide a menu item that allows the device
   user to return to a previous control to change the data entered.

   6.   Call IDIALOG_GetControl() when data entry is complete to obtain the values
   the device user has entered or selected in each control.

   7.   Call ISHELL_EndDialog() to terminate the dialog.

   NOTE: Dialog titles are not supported in the current version of BREW.

   NOTE: In a multi-control dialog, the left and right arrow keys should tab up and
   down in the list of the dialog controls. In the current version of BREW, the left
   arrow key tabs down, and the right arrow key does nothing.

IDIALOG_SetEventHandler()

Description:
    This function sets or resets the event handler for a dialog. This function can
   be used to select an alternate event callback for application events sent by a dialog
   to an application or for events not processed by the dialog. If this event handler
   must receive all events that are not handled by the dialog, then the property DLG_HANDLE_ALL_EVENTS
   must be set using IDIALOG_SetProperties(). If this property is set, the event handler
   that is set using IDIALOG_SetEventHandler() will get all events that are not handled
   by the dialog.If this property is NOT set, then the event handler registered using
   IDIALOG_SetEventHandler() will only receive events sent from the dialog (EVT_DIALOG_END,
   EVT_COMMAND).

   While a dialog is active, the chain in which events are passed around is:
===pre>
    1.   The event is given to the controls in the dialog.
    2.   The event is sent to the event handler registered
       - If the dialog did not handle the event, and
       - If the property DLG_HANDLE_ALL_EVENTS is set and
       - If an event handler is registered.
    3.   The Event is sent to the current application
       - If this event handler did not handle this event.

IStatic Interface

The IStatic Interface allows you to create a static text control, that consists
of a read-only text message and a title that appears at the top of the control's
rectangle. Unlike the text controls created with the ITextCtl Interface, the text
in a static text control cannot be entered or modified by the device user. The text
message is broken into lines within the control rectangle with each line containing
an integral number of words (that is, words are not broken across lines) except
when the word is longer than the width of the control rectangle in which case the 
word is wrapped to the next line. If the text message is too long to completely fit
on the device screen, the static text control automatically scrolls the message. 
When the end of the message is reached, the continuous scrolling starts again from 
the beginning. Instead of using a text message as the control's contents, choose to 
display an animated bitmap created with the IImage Interface. If this option is selected, 
the bitmap is displayed centered inside the static text control's rectangle.

The following steps are typically followed to use a static text control (refer to
the function descriptions in the following subsections and the IStatic Interface
usage examples for details on the parameter lists and return values of each IStatic
Interface function).
===H2>
To use a static text control
===/H2>

1.   Create an instance of an IStatic Interface using the ISHELL_CreateInstance().

2.   Set the dimensions of the control's rectangle using the ISTATIC_SetRect().

3.   Obtain the text for the control's title and text message strings either by
reading them from a BREW resource file or from text strings in your code. If a bitmap
is being used in place of the text message, read in the bitmap and use IIMAGE_SetParm()
function to set its animation properties (number of frames, animation rate, and
other items).

4.   Call ISTATIC_SetText() to specify the control's title string, message string
or bitmap, and the fonts to be used for the title and text. You must call ISTATIC_SetRect()
(see step 2) before calling ISTATIC_SetText(), because the latter uses information
about the control rectangle to determine how to display the control.

5.   Call ISTATIC_Redraw() to display the control's contents on the screen.

6.   When the control is no longer needed, call ISTATIC_Release(). This function
frees the memory for the control's message text and title, but it does NOT release
an animated bitmap. You must explicitly release the IImage Interface if you created
an instance of one in step 3.

ISTATIC_SetTextEx()

Description:
    This method sets the text of the IStatic object. The function allows the caller
to:
     -    Specify text of either single-byte or double-byte width according to the
flags passed to the ISTATIC_SetProperties function. By default, text is considered
to be double-byte unless the ST_ASCII property has been set.
     -    Append to or replace the existing text
     -    Read text from an input stream. This allows the caller to avoid buffering
text from a file or socket.
    Please note the following:
     -    Title text is ALWAYS assumed to be double-byte. ST_ASCII only impacts
the text and not the title.
     -    Changing the ST_ASCII property automatically frees/resets the text in
the control.
     -    After the ST_ASCII property has been set or cleared, all text operations
are assumed to be either single or double-byte.
     -    Passing both pbText and pStream parameters add/replace the existing text
from pbText and then read from the stream.

Prototype:
    boolean ISTATIC_SetTextEx
    (
    IStatic * pIStatic,
    byte * pbText,
    IAStream * pStream,
    boolean bAppend
    )

Parameters:
    pIStatic :  Pointer to the IStatic Interface object.
    pbText :  Pointer to the text.
    pStream :  Pointer to the text stream.
    bAppend :  TRUE to append text, FALSE to reset text.

Return Value:
    TRUE: the text was set or added.
    FALSE: the text was not set or added.
