============================
IFileMgr simulation

IFileMgr is partly simumated.

IFileMgr is simulated using Windows file system for both primary and
secondary storage (MMC1).

MMC1 directory can be specified via Properties pane or
"MMC1Dir" in BREW_Emu.dat. This referes to the AEEFS_CARD0_DIR
(fs:/card0/) path exposed by BREW.

IFileMgr_GetFreeSpaceEx() is simulated for MMC1 (AEEFS_CARD0_DIR)
from 3.1.5SP01 release onwards.

File size and number of files in filesystem restrictions
enforced via devicepack entry (See Memory section in
devicepack).

Certain file extensions can be excluded from filesystem size
quota by specifying exclusion list in BREW_Emu.dat. 

Please refer to SDK users docs for details.
