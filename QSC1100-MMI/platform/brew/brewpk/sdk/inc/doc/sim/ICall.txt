============================
ICall simulation

ICall is partly simumated.

DTMF tones are not simulated.

Telephony simulator depends on the underlying network
being simulated. For example, multiple calls are simulated
only for GSM and UMTS network types.

See Also:
ITAPI, ITelephone, ICallMgr, and IPhoneCtl
interfaces for more information on telephony services.
