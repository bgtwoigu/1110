Simulator Support DOCUMENTATION
============================
ISockPort simulation

ISockPort is simulated.
Sockets are simulated using Windows sockets. Only socket options supported by Windows sockets or ones that can be supported in terms of Windows sockets are fully supported.

- Simulator fully supports the following socket options:

- AEE_SO_KEEPALIVE (see SO_KEEPALIVE Windows option)
- AEE_SO_LINGER (see SO_LINGER Windows option)
- AEE_SO_RCVBUF (see SO_RCVBUF Windows option)
- AEE_SO_SNDBUF (see SO_SNDBUF Windows option)
- AEE_TCP_NODELAY (see TCP_NODELAY Windows option)
- AEE_IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP – (for BCMCS and MFLO networks, see   
   IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP Windows socket option)
- AEE_IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP – (for BCMCS and MFLO networks, see 
   IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP Windows socket option)
- AEE_SO_SDB_ACK_CB
- AEE_IP_TTL (see IP_TTL Windows option)

For more information regarding these options please see BREW header files and the corresponding Windows Sockets documentation.

- Simulator does not support the following socket options:

AEE_TCP_DELAYED_ACK
AEE_TCP_SACK
AEE_TCP_TIME_STAMP
AEE_TCP_MAXSEG
AEE_IP_TOS
AEE_IPV6_TCLASS
AEE_SO_REUSEADDR (setting is disabled, getting always returns 0)
AEE_SO_DISABLE_FLOW_FWDING (setting and getting is enabled, but it has no actual effect on the socket’s behavior)
