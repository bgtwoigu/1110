=====================================================================
  INTERFACES   DOCUMENTATION
=====================================================================

ISoundPlayer Interface

The ISoundPlayer Interface has been deprecated, use the IMedia Interface.

ISoundPlayer interface provides audio multimedia services. ISoundPlayer supports
MIDI, MP3 and QCP (QUALCOMM PureVoice or QCELP) formats. For more details on QCP
format and the associated BREW SDK tools, please refer to BREW SDK User's Guide.

Creating ISoundPlayer Instance

You can create ISoundPlayer instance in two ways:

1.   Using ISHELL_CreateInstance() with AEECLSID_SOUNDPLAYER as ClassID.

2.   Using ISHELL_GetHandler() with AEEHandlerType set to HTYPE_SOUND and MIME string
set to snd/midi for MIDI, snd/mp3 for MP3, or snd/qcp for QCP formats. Call ISHELL_CreateInstance()
with the returned ClassID.

ISoundPlayer Input Types

You can specify the audio source,(input type and data), in AEESoundPlayerInfo structure
and set it using ISOUNDPLAYER_SetInfo(). The ISoundPlayer Interface can play using
a memory buffer, SDT_BUFFER or file, SDT_FILE. Playback while streaming is not supported,
but you can associate an IAStream with ISoundPlayer using ISOUNDPLAYER_SetStream().
ISoundPlayer reads the entire data from the stream into a buffer, and plays the
buffer.

ISOUNDPLAYER_GetInfo() returns the current audio source if a pointer to AEESoundPlayerInfo
is given.

NOTE: ISoundPlayer does not set the audio source if it is busy. ISoundPlayer is
busy if it is playing, executing a command, or streaming input data. To find if
ISoundPlayer is busy, you call: int ISOUNDPLAYER_GetInfo(pISoundPlayer, NULL); It
returns EIDLE if ISoundPlayer is idle or EITEMBUSY if it is busy.

NOTE: ISOUNDPLAYER_Set() is deprecated. Instead use ISOUNDPLAYER_SetInfo() which
provides better access to ISoundPlayer.

Playback Control

ISoundPlayer provides the following playback control functions:


ISOUNDPLAYER_Play() 
 To play the MIDI/MP3/QCP file
 
ISOUNDPLAYER_Stop() 
 To stop the playback
 
ISOUNDPLAYER_Rewind() 
 To rewind playback for n milliseconds. This command is not supported for QCP format.
 
ISOUNDPLAYER_FastForward() 
 To fast forward playback for n milliseconds This command is not supported for QCP
format.
 
ISOUNDPLAYER_Pause() 
 To pause the playback, This command is not supported for QCP format.
 
ISOUNDPLAYER_Resume() 
 To resume the playback This command is not supported for QCP format.
 
ISOUNDPLAYER_SetTempo() 
 To set playback tempo for MIDI. Not applicable for MP3 and QCP.
 
ISOUNDPLAYER_SetTune() 
 To set the pitch level, in half step increments, of the current MIDI playback.
Not applicable for MP3 and QCP
 


ISOUNDPLAYER_Play() gets precedence over ISOUNDPLAYER_GetTotalTime(). There can
be only one active ISOUNDPLAYER_Play(). You need to issue a stop before you can
call another ISOUNDPLAYER_Play(). Only one of the commands from #4 -#9 (in the table
above) can be active at any time. ISoundPlayer sends AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_FAILURE if
a command does not succeed.

Callback Notification

Most of the calls to ISoundPlayer API are asynchronous in nature. If application
is to receive status and events from ISoundPlayer, the application must register
a callback notification function using ISOUNDPLAYER_RegisterNotify(). ISoundPlayer
sends status and events to the user application through this registered callback
function.

There are five types of callback functions invoked by the ISoundPlayer Interface.

AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_PLAY_CB

AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_STATUS_CB

AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_TIME_CB

AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_SOUND_CB

AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_VOLUME_CB

Each callback type, in turn, contains a set of status indications and data that
are valid only for callbacks of that type.

For example, for AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_PLAY_CB, the status type can be:

AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_SUCCESS

AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_PAUSE

AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_RESUME

and so forth

Any Data is returned in a callback through the dwParam parameter that points to
an AEESoundPlayerCmdData structure if data is present. Otherwise the dwParam is
NULL.

During playback, every second the applet is notified of AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_TICK_ UPDATE
status by AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_PLAY_CB. This can be used by the applet to update the
progress of playback.

After rewind, fast forward, pause, or resume, the dwParam parameter of AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_PLAY_CB
callback function's dwParam points to the current position in milliseconds of the
playback. Again, applets can use this to update the playback progress. These mechanisms
are demonstrated in the sample MIDI-MP3 Player applet.

It is not always required to register a callback function. Choose not to get any
ISoundPlayer events by calling ISOUNDPLAYER_RegisterNotify() as follows:

ISOUNDPLAYER_RegisterNotify(pISoundPlayer, NULL, NULL);

Audio Device And Volume Control

ISoundPlayer internally uses an instance of ISound for setting the audio device
parameters (ISOUNDPLAYER_SetSoundDevice()) and for setting/getting the volume of
the output (ISOUNDPLAYER_SetVolume() and ISOUNDPLAYER_GetVolume()). You do not need
to create an ISound instance for these operations.

To use the services of ISoundPlayer Interface

1.   Create the ISoundPlayer object by calling ISHELL_CreateInstance() with AEECLSID_SOUNDPLAYER
as ClassID.

2.   Call ISOUNDPLAYER_RegisterNotify() to register the ISoundPlayer callback function.
The ISoundPlayer Interface always uses this callback function to notify the applet
of any events or status changes.

3.   Set the source of the MIDI/MP3/QCP media (file/buffer using the ISOUNDPLAYER_SetInfo()
function. Be sure to check if it is successful.

4.   In the applet event handler, call any of the playback control functions like
ISOUNDPLAYER_GetTotalTime(), ISOUNDPLAYER_Play().

5.   Before exiting, always:

a.   Un-register the callback function by calling

     ISOUNDPLAYER_RegisterNotify(pISoundPlayer, NULL, NULL)

b.   Call ISOUNDPLAYER_Stop() if playback is active.

ISOUNDPLAYER_FastForward()

Description:
    This function issues a command to fast-forward the current MIDI/MP3 playback.

Prototype:
    void ISOUNDPLAYER_FastForward
    (
    ISoundPlayer * pISoundPlayer, 
    uint32 dwTime
    )

Parameters:
    pISoundPlayer  :  Pointer to the ISoundPlayer Interface object.
    dwTime  :  Amount of time, in milliseconds, to fast-forward the current playback.

Return Value:
    None

Comments:
    This command has no effect on QCP format

Side Effects:
    The result of the operation is sent to the client through the callback function
pointer. The status can be one of the following values:
~
    AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_SUCCESS 
     Successful and accepted the fast-forward command.~
    AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_FAILURE 
     Failed and did not accept the fast-forward command. Possibly, playback is not
active or another command is active.~
*

    Fast-forwarding past the end of the file ends the current audio playback and
triggers a AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_DONE playback callback. This API triggers AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_FFORWARD
playback callback if playback is active. When the fast-forward function is completed,
AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_RESUME playback callback if the audio file has not ended.

ISOUNDPLAYER_Set()
    NOTE: This function is deprecated. Use ISOUNDPLAYER_SetInfo() instead.

Description:
    This function frees the memory associated with previous input data buffer, if
any, and sets the current input data buffer as the source of the MIDI/MP3/QCP audio.
    NOTE: The SDT_VOICEPROMPT input source is not supported in the current version
of BREW.

Prototype:
    void ISOUNDPLAYER_Set
    (
    ISoundPlayer * pISoundPlayer,

    )

Parameters:
    pISoundPlayer  :  Pointer to the ISoundPlayer Interface object.
    t  :  Source type of pData. Supported values include:
     -    SDT_FILE: Specified data is file name.
     -    SDT_BUFFER: Specified data is raw buffer.
    pData  :  Pointer to the data of specified type.

Return Value:
    None

Comments:
    NOTE: Only SDT_FILE is supported in the BREW Simulator.

Side Effects:
    If the input type is SDT_FILE, ISoundPlayer copies the file name from pData
into its local buffer. It is the application's responsibility to free the memory
allocated for pData.

    If the input type is SDT_BUFFER, ISoundPlayer does not make its own copy, but
uses the pData pointer to the application-allocated buffer. ISoundPlayer frees this
memory after another ISOUNDPLAYER_Set() or last ISOUNDPLAYER_Release(). The application
should not free this memory.

Parameters:
    pISoundPlayer  :  Pointer to the ISoundPlayer Interface object.
    pInfo  :  Audio source of ISoundPlayer.

Return Value:
    AEE_SUCCESS, if the audio source is set, if pInfo is not NULL or if the audio
source is reset successfully, if pInfo is NULL. ~
    Error Codes:
~
    EITEMBUSY, if ISoundPlayer is busy. ISoundPlayer is busy if it is currently
playing, executing a command, or streaming input data.~
    EBADPARM, if the function encounters a bad parameter (like setting pInfo ->
dwSize to zero).~
    EUNSUPPORTED, if the input type is not supported in the current version of BREW.~
*

Comments:
    If pInfo is NULL, a successful execution of this function causes ISoundPlayer
to release the memory it allocated for the previous audio source. It is applications
responsibility to free the memory allocated for pInfo -> pData.

Side Effects:
    If the audio source is set successfully, memory allocated by ISoundPlayer for
previous audio source is released. If the input type is SDT_FILE, ISoundPlayer copies
the file name from pInfo -> pData into its local buffer.

ISOUNDPLAYER_SetStream()

Description:
    This function allows an IAStream Interface to be associated with an ISoundPlayer
instance to allow audio source data to be streamed from IAStream (like file or socket).

Prototype:
    void ISOUNDPLAYER_SetStream
    (
    ISoundPlayer * pISoundPlayer, 
    IAStream * ps
    )

Parameters:
    pISoundPlayer  :  Pointer to the ISoundPlayer Interface object that receives
the streaming audio input.
    ps :  Pointer to an instance of a class that implements the IAStream Interface
(for example, the IFile Interface or the ISocket Interface).

Return Value:
    None

Comments:
    ISOUNDPLAYER_SetStream() only supports network stream from TCP socket but not
UDP socket.

    ISoundPlayer reads the whole stream into a buffer and internally uses SDT_BUFFER
as input type.

Side Effects:
    If ISoundPlayer is not busy, then memory allocated (by ISoundPlayer) for previous
audio source is released.

    The function asynchronously triggers a AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_STATUS callback. The
status list includes:
~
    AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_SUCCESS
     Audio source data streaming successfully completed.~
    AEE_SOUNDPLAYER_FAILURE
     Audio source data streaming failed. Reasons can be ISoundPlayer is busy or
streaming error.~
*

    If streaming is successful, then internally ISoundPlayer allocates memory for
the buffer and sets the audio source type as SDT_BUFFER. The application need not
worry about this memory.

    dwTempoFactor  :  This parameter is used to modify the playback tempo as a percentage
of the normal playback tempo. Possibly, playback is not active or another command
is active. A dwTempoFactor of 50 means half of the normal playback tempo. The maximum
supported tempo factor is 500% or five times of the normal playback tempo. The minimum
tempo factor is 1% of the normal playback tempo. The tempo factor is initially 100%
when the ISOUNDPLAYER_Play() function is called.
