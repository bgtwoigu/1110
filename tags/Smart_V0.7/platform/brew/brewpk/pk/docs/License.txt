These U.S. government restrictions are implemented principally through the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR", 15 C.F.R. §§ 730 et seq., available at http://www.bis.doc.gov/) administered by Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security and the Foreign Asset Control Regulations administered by the Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC", 30 C.F.R.

You agree that neither You nor Your affiliates will directly or indirectly export, re-export, transfer, or release, or cause to be exported or re-exported (herein referred to as "export"), any such Products or any direct product thereof to any destination or entity prohibited or restricted under U.S. law including but not limited to U.S. government embargoed or sanctioned countries, entities or nationals thereof, unless it shall obtain prior to export an authorization from the applicable U.S. government agency either in writing or as provided by applicable regulation.  The U.S. government maintains embargoes or sanctions against the countries listed in the EAR, Country Groups E:1/2 to Part 740, Supplement 1.  The current list of embargoed or sanctioned countries consists of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria.  This list is amended by the U.S. government from time to time and all such amendments shall be applicable to this Agreement. To the extent such Products are subject to National Security controls, You also agree that, unless authorized by U.S. law (either by regulation, specific written authorization, or qualification for an applicable license exception, such as License Exception ENC), You shall not knowingly export, directly or indirectly, any of the Products, or the direct product thereof, to any country or nationals thereof listed in Country Group D:1 in Supplement No. 1 to Part 740 of the EAR, as the same may be amended from time to time.  Unless otherwise authorized by U.S. export control laws or by applicable authorization from the proper U.S. government agency, You further agree that no Products received from QUALCOMM or its affiliates will be directly or indirectly employed in missile technology, sensitive nuclear, or chemical biological weapons end uses or in any manner transferred to any party for any such end use.  Furthermore, You agree not to export Products listed in EAR Supplement No. 2 to Part 744 for military end-uses in the People's Republic of China as defined in the EAR Part 744.21. You also agrees to comply with all trade laws applicable in other country jurisdictions as they pertain to import, use, export or distribution.  Notwithstanding any other provision, the terms of this Section 9 (Export Compliance Assurances) shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

10.	GOVERNMENT END USERS.  If You are acting on behalf of an agency or instrumentality of the U. S. government, the Software and Documentation, as applicable, are "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation" developed exclusively at private expense by QUALCOMM.

The individual accepting the terms of this Agreement represents and warrants to QUALCOMM that they have the authority to bind such entity to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

12.	GENERAL.  This Agreement is governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly disclaimed and shall not apply.  Any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement must be brought exclusively in a federal or state court located in San Diego County, California and You consent to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts. If any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected.  This Agreement is the entire and exclusive agreement between QUALCOMM and You with respect to the Software and supersedes all prior agreements (whether written or oral) and other communications between QUALCOMM and You with respect to the Software.
