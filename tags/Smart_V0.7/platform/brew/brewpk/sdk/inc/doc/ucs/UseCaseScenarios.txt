To enhance the clarity and details of BREW interfaces documentation, QUALCOMM is providing BREW Interfaces Use Case Scenarios documents. 

==Overview==
For a BREW interface this document presents a series of sections covering use case scenarios of selected interfaces. The documentation includes description, call flows, and code snippets.

The objective is to clearly show the usage of APIs of the interface. The target audiences are:
* OEMs to get a clear understanding of the interface for porting the interface 
* Application developers to make use of the interface for their applications
* 
This document goes beyond the existing BREW documentation and covers the areas that are not obvious to the user. 

==Conventions==
Following conventions are used throughout this document:

*	Courier font denotes code snippet
*	pme refers to the instance of global BREW app structure
*	p<Interface Name> is an identifier that refers to an instance of BREW interface (class). For example, pIMedia refers to an instance of IMedia-based class
