IPosdet simulation

IPosdet is simulated.

BREW Simulator supports GPS emulation for position determination. Sector information is not simulated.

Users can set the GPS emulation in the Tools->GPS Emulation menu to use a pre-recorded NMEA file as GPS input (e.g.:
sdk\bin\dataFiles\toDownTown.bgp), or connect an NMEAoutput
capable GPS device. An offline utility called NMEALogger.exe can be used to record an NMEA file from data coming from a GPS device connected to the serial port of
the desktop/laptop.
