AEEGPSMode

Description:
   This structure is used to specify the mode of operation of the GPS
   system on the device.

Definition:
   typedef  uint16      AEEGPSMode;
   
Supported values:

   AEEGPS_MODE_ONE_SHOT       : This mode is the default mode. It allows an application to 
                                request a position fix without worrying about which underlying 
                                mode is used by the position determination engine. This mode 
                                may not be optimal for repeated position determination requests
                                and should be used when only a single position determination 
                                request will be placed. If an application needs to have control over
                                the mode, use the AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_LOCAL or AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_NETWORK
                                modes, which are described below.~
                                
                                In this mode, the position determination engine uses the 
                                AEEGPSConfig.optim member to determine how to optimize its performance. 
                                See AEEGPSOpt for more information on possible optimizations. Since 
                                this mode indicates only a single position request will be placed, the 
                                AEEGPSConfig.nInterval and AEEGPSConfig.nFixes members are ignored.~

   AEEGPS_MODE_DLOAD_FIRST    : This mode is intended for applications which would like the
                                position results to be computed locally on the mobile device
                                (after the intial assistance data is downloaded from the server), 
                                and are making repeated position determination requests.~ 
                                
                                Applications can use this mode to download the assistance data 
                                (almanac and ephermis) from the location server. Applications can 
                                specify a request to only download the assistance data by using a 
                                AEEGPSReq type of AEE_GPSINFO_NONE when calling IPOSDET_GetGPSInfo().
                                Applications may want to do this as they are starting up (such as while
                                they display their splash screen) in order to reduce the time to 
                                obtain the first fix. Applications may also specify other request 
                                types, in which case the assistance data will be obtained in addition 
                                to the requested position information.~
                                
                                Applications can take advantage of performance optimizations by the
                                device's position determination engine by changing the mode to 
                                AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_LOCAL for subsequent position location requests.~
                                
                                Note that using AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_LOCAL mode also downloads the assistance
                                data from the location server. In this mode, the device will automatically 
                                refresh the assistance data if it is unavailable or obsolete when a fix is 
                                requested. The device uses the duration computed by (nFixes * nInterval) to 
                                determine the period for which assistance data is required. Periodically using 
                                AEEGPS_MODE_DLOAD_FIRST mode gives the application some control over when the 
                                almanac and ephermis data is downloaded or refreshed.~

   AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_LOCAL    : This mode may be used by applications which are making multiple
                                position determination requests and want the position results
                                to be computed on the device. It is suited for applications
                                which intend to perform tracking, and require frequent, fast 
                                location/velocity/altitude information.~ 
                                
                                This mode also minimizes requests to the network for position 
                                determination information. The mobile will compute the 
                                position locally on the device. This mode uses aiding satellite 
                                data (ephemeris data and almanac) downloaded from the location 
                                server. If the aiding data in the device is unavailable or 
                                becomes invalid, the device seeks that information from the 
                                location server automatically (as it does in 
                                AEEGPS_MODE_DLOAD_FIRST mode).~

                                This mode does not implement any persistent tracking session. 
                                To perform tracking, an application must call 
                                IPOSDET_GetGPSInfo() at regular intervals.~

   AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_NETWORK  : This mode may be used by applications which are making multiple
                                position determination requests. In this mode, the location 
                                server will compute the position using data provided by the 
                                device. The device communicates with the server using TCP/IP.~

                                This mode does not implement a persistent tracking session. 
                                To perform tracking, an application must call 
                                IPOSDET_GetGPSInfo() at regular intervals.~ 

   AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_OPTIMAL  : This mode allows applications to request a position fix without
                                worrying about which underlying method is used by the position 
                                determination engine. It may be used by applications which are 
                                making multiple position determination requests. This mode 
                                does not implement a persistent tracking session. To perform 
                                tracking, an application must call IPOSDET_GetGPSInfo() at 
                                regular intervals.~ 
                                
                                This mode allows applications to request that the position 
                                determination requests be optimized. The type of optimization 
                                desired is specified by the AEEGPSConfig.optim member, which 
                                is set using IPOSDET_SetGPSConfig(). For more information
                                about possible optimizations, see AEEGPSOpt. AEEGPS_OPT_NONE is 
                                not an acceptable value for this mode and will result in EBADPARM. 
                                This mode also makes use of the AEEGPSConfig.nFixes and 
                                nInterval members. If nFixes=1, this mode is equivalent to 
                                AEEGPS_MODE_ONE_SHOT. If an application needs to have control 
                                over the position determination process, use the 
                                AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_LOCAL or AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_OPTIMAL modes.~
 
   AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_STANDALONE : This mode should be used when the mobile device autonomously 
                                performs position determination, without communicating with an 
                                outside position location server. This mode is suited for
                                applications which intend to perform position fixes even when
                                terrestrial wireless service is unavailable. In this method, 
                                the device obtains GPS satellite ephemeris and almanac data by 
                                decoding the GPS signals (the same way a traditional GPS 
                                receiver does). This mode differs from the 
                                AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_LOCAL mode because in the 
                                AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_LOCAL mode, the device seeks the GPS satellite 
                                ephemeris and almanac data from the position location server 
                                using wireless TCP/IP communication.~

   AEEGPS_MODE_DEFAULT        : The default mode of operation, which is set to 
                                AEEGPS_MODE_ONE_SHOT.~

Comments:
   Not all devices with PosDet capability are capable of AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_LOCAL or
   AEEGPS_MODE_DLOAD_FIRST. Setting the mode on such devices will result in EUNSUPPORTED.

AEEGPSInfoVersion

Description:
   Describes the version of AEEGPSInfo structure.
 
Definition:
   typedef  uint8   AEEGPSInfoVersion;
   
Supported values:

   AEEGPS_GETINFO_VERSION_0 : No extended data members in the AEEGPSInfo structure.
   AEEGPS_GETINFO_VERSION_1 : Version 1 of the AEEGPSInfo structure, dwTimeMS member added

Comments:
   In the AEEGPSInfo structure, the flag AEEGPS_VALID_VERSION indicates if the version 
   field of the AEEGPSInfo structure is supported by the device. If this flag is not set 
   the device supports AEEGPS_GETINFO_VERSION_0.

AEEGPSAccuracy

Description:
   Describes the accuracy of the position fix. The accuracy levels are implementation 
   specific and may vary between devices. The accuracy levels correspond to an accuracy 
   value in meters.

Definition:
   typedef  uint8      AEEGPSAccuracy;

Supported values:
   AEEGPS_ACCURACY_LEVEL1 : Lowest accuracy
   AEEGPS_ACCURACY_LEVEL2 : 
   AEEGPS_ACCURACY_LEVEL3 : 
   AEEGPS_ACCURACY_LEVEL4 : 
   AEEGPS_ACCURACY_LEVEL5 : 
   AEEGPS_ACCURACY_LEVEL6 : Highest accuracy
   AEEGPS_ACCURACY_LOWEST : Defined as AEEGPS_ACCURACY_LEVEL1
   AEEGPS_ACCURACY_HIGHEST: Defined as AEEGPS_ACCURACY_LEVEL6

Comments:
   As a default value, AEEGPS_ACCURACY_LEVEL1 is typically used. Network operators (carriers) 
   may have their own recommendations on what AEEGPSAccuracy level should be used for
   various types of applications.~ 

   When the mode AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_OPTIMAL is used, the device's position determination
   engine may try to compute the position fix locally on the device first. If the position 
   cannot be computed locally and meet the requested accuracy level, the position determination
   engine may attempt to compute a more accurate position fix by using the location server.~

AEEGPSReq

Description:
   Describes the type of request the application is placing to the 
   IPOSDET_GetGPSInfo() interface.

Definition:
   typedef  uint8   AEEGPSReq;
   
Supported values:
   The following flags indicate what type of information is being requested:
	AEEGPS_GETINFO_NONE:     No position information is requested
	AEEGPS_GETINFO_LOCATION: Get the location
	AEEGPS_GETINFO_VELOCITY: Get the velocity
	AEEGPS_GETINFO_ALTITUDE: Get the altitude

   The flag AEEGPS_GETINFO_NONE is applicable only when the configured mode is of
   type AEEGPS_MODE_DLOAD_FIRST (AEEGPSConfig.mode = AEEGPS_MODE_DLOAD_FIRST). See 
   the description of AEEGPS_MODE_DLOAD_FIRST mode for more information.

   The following flags indicate what version of the AEEGPSInfo structure is being used. 
         AEEGPS_GETINFO_VERSION_0: No extended data members in the AEEGPSInfo structure
         AEEGPS_GETINFO_VERSION_1: AEEGPS_GETINFO_VERSION_1 members of AEEGPSInfo are
         desired.
         
   Specifying a version greater than AEEGPS_GETINFO_VERSION_0 implies that the 
   AEEGPSInfo structure has been extended and includes additional data members. 
   See AEEGPSGetInfoVersion for details on what members were added in each version.

   The flags (excluding AEEGPS_GETINFO_NONE) can be combined to get more than one type of 
   information. For example, the req specification (AEEGPS_GETINFO_LOCATION|AEEGPS_GETINFO_VERSION_1) 
   indicates to get the (2D) position along with any AEEGPS_GETINFO_VERSION_1 members of AEEGPSInfo.

Comments:
   The three most significant bits of the request, denoted by the mask 
   AEEGPS_GETINFO_VERSION_MASK, represent the version number for AEEGPSInfo buffer.

AEEGPSOpt

Description:
   This data type is used to specify the optimization desired from the
   position determination subsystem.

Definition:
   typedef  uint8      AEEGPSOpt;

Supported values:
   AEEGPS_OPT_NONE        : Does not apply any optimization methods.
   AEEGPS_OPT_SPEED       : Get a position fix in the fastest manner possible. Based on 
                            the capabilities and current state of the device, the device 
                            will select the best method to obtain a position fix in the 
                            least amount of time. When used in conjunction with 
                            AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_OPTIMAL or AEEGPS_MODE_ONE_SHOT, this will
                            result in a position fix in the fastest manner possible.
   AEEGPS_OPT_ACCURACY    : Get a position fix in the most accurate manner possible. This
                            This option may require a longer time to compute a position
                            fix and may require network connectivity, or may result in 
                            more data burst messages. When used in conjunction with 
                            AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_OPTIMAL or AEEGPS_MODE_ONE_SHOT modes, this 
                            will result in the most accurate position fix possible.
   AEEGPS_OPT_PAYLOAD     : Get a position fix using the manner that results in no or 
                            minimal data exchange with the remote location server. 
                            For example, if a device is capable of performing a Standalone 
                            GPS fix, that option may result in the least data being exchanged 
                            with the location server and may be used if AEEGPS_OPT_PAYLOAD
                            is specified.
   AEEGPS_OPT_DEFAULT     : This is set to AEEGPS_OPT_NONE.


Comments:
   Applications can specify the accuracy level desired for a position fix regardless of 
   the optimization that is specified. This is done by setting the AEEGPSAccuracy parameter
   to the desired accuracy level requirement when calling IPOSDET_GetGPSInfo().

AEEGPSSvrType

Description:
   This data type is used to specify the transport layer by which the device will 
   reach the location server. It is recommended to use the default setting
   AEEGPS_SERVER_DEFAULT so that the device may use the preferred location server.
   
Definition:
   typedef  uint32      AEEGPSSvrType;

Supported values:
   AEEGPS_SERVER_DEFAULT  : Use the location server IP address, port number and other 
                            location server configuration parameters that have been 
                            provisioned into the device by the network operator or OEM. This 
                            setting should be used for commercial versions of applications.~
   AEEGPS_SERVER_IP       : Use a TCP/IP data connection to contact the location server. The 
                            application must specify the IP address and Port number 
                            (see also AEEGPSIPServer). This setting may be useful
                            for testing an application, as it allows the developer to
                            update the location server IP address in a flexible way.~
   AEEGPS_SERVER_DBURST   : Use data burst messages as the transport to/from the
                            location server. (This server type may not be supported in
                            all the mobile networks. Using this server type in such
                            event causes EUNSUPPORTED with IPOSDET_SetGPSConfig.)~

AEEGPSConfig

Description:
   This structure is used to configure the GPS engine provided by this interface.

Definition:
   typedef struct _AEEGPSConfig {
      AEEGPSMode        mode;
      uint16            nFixes;
      uint16            nInterval;
      AEEGPSOpt         optim;
      AEEGPSQos         qos;
      AEEGPSServer      server;
   } AEEGPSConfig;

Members:
   mode:      This is used to specify which of several operating modes the underlying
              GPS engine should use. Possible values are described under AEEGPSMode.

   nFixes:    Estimated number of repetitive position determination requests that will 
              be made using this interface when using AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_LOCAL or 
              AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_NETWORK. This information is passed to 
              the position determination engine so it can use estimates of 
              upcoming position determination requests to optimize its 
              performance in terms of battery life and time to fix.~ 
              
              The application sets nFixes to an estimate of the number of fixes to be 
              placed. For each position determination request, the IPOSDET interface  
              decrements the value of nFixes by one, until the value of nFixes=1. 
              The value of nFixes remains at one (i.e. the IPOSDET interface does not 
              decrement the value of nFixes once it reaches 1) until it is set to a 
              different value using IPOSDET_SetGPSConfig().~ 

              NOTE: nFixes is an estimate of the number of position determination requests 
              the application will be placing. Each position determination request results 
              in only one position fix -- nFixes does NOT cause multiple fixes to be returned 
              for a single call to IPOSDET_GetGPSInfo(). To receive multiple position fixes, 
              the application will have to make multiple calls to IPOSDET_GetGPSInfo().~ 

              The application can change the value of nFixes at any point using  
              IPOSDET_SetGPSConfig(). The value should be set to 1 for a single position  
              determination request. A value of 0 implies an unknown number of position 
              requests.~ 

   nInterval: Estimated interval between consequtive position determination requests (in  
              seconds). This information is passed to the position determination engine so  
              it can use estimates of upcoming position determination requests to optimize its  
              performance in terms of battery life and time to fix.~ 

   optim:     The position determination engine can use information about upcoming 
              requests to optimize its performance. The optim parameter tells the 
              position determination engine how to optimize its performance.  
              Possible values are described by AEEGPSOpt.~ 

   qos:       Quality of Service. The qos parameter practically corresponds to the  
              maximum amount of time (expressed in number of seconds) that the 
              application wants the position determination engine to search for  
              satellites. Note that in blue sky conditions, the search for 
              satellites may take only a few seconds even if the qos is set to a  
              much higher value.~  
              
              Values between 0-255 are valid, 255 providing the highest quality  
              of service. Note: The underlying implementation may round off the  
              maximum value to less than 255. Higher qos values may result 
              in greater accuracy of position fixes, and longer fix times. 
              Lower qos values may result in shorter times to obtain position  
              fixes. It is recommended that applications use  
              AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_OPTIMAL or AEEGPS_MODE_ONE_SHOT modes if the  
              application goal is to focus on speed or accuracy and you do not  
              want to work with the qos parameter.~ 
              
              Setting qos=0 indicates that no time should be spend searching for  
              satellites.  On some devices, this may result in a pure AFLT fix. 
              (AFLT computes the position using triangulation based on multiple  
              cell transmitters as reference.) Position fixes made without the  
              use of satellite data (such as AFLT fixes) perform no pseudo-range  
              measurements against GPS satellites. Since a fix made with qos=0 relies  
              on the wireless network for information to compute a position fix, a  
              qos value of 0 should not be used when AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_LOCAL or   
              AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_STANDALONE are specified.~  

              The accuracy of a fix made with qos=0 is influenced by the location  
              server's base station almanac accuracy, the device calibration, and   
              other possible factors, such as the number of base station pilot   
              channels visible to the device.~  
              
              The qos parameter may be ignored on certain mobile devices.~ 

   server:    Server configuration. This structure specifies the server type 
              and configuration. Possible server types are: 
~
              AEEGPS_SERVER_DEFAULT~
              AEEGPS_SERVER_IP~
              AEEGPS_SERVER_DBURST ~
*
              Effective BREW 3.1, applications using server type other than  
              AEEGPS_SERVER_DEFAULT must have privilege to the group id  
              AEECLSID_LOCATIONSERVER.~ 

              If the server type is AEEGPS_SERVER_IP, the IP Address and port
              of the Position Determination server must be specified. If the port
              number is specified as 0, connection will be attempted on a default
              port for the service.~

                                 this flag is not set device supports 
                                 AEEGPS_GETINFO_VERSION_0.~

*

   accuracy is specified by 6 levels starting from AEEGPS_ACCURACY_LEVEL1 to
   AEEGPS_ACCURACY_LEVEL6. See AEEGPSAccuracy for more information.

   status may contain following information indicating the Success or Failure
   of the GetGpsInfo request :
~
     AEEGPS_ERR_NO_ERR : The fix was successfully returned by the handset GPS engine.

     AEEGPS_ERR_GENERAL_FAILURE : This error indicates a general failure in the system. The
     application may abort the sessions and display an error message to the user.
	 
     AEEGPS_ERR_TIMEOUT : This error indicates the fix could not be obtained within the time 
     range specified by the handset implmentation. This time range is device-dependent and may 
     differ from one device to another. The application may retry position requests on this error. 
     If the application encounters repeated timeouts, the application may abort the sessions and 
     display an error message to the user. Timeouts may occur for many reasons, including inability
     of the device to communicate with the location server (such as if the location server IP 
     address and port are not provisioned or are provisioned incorrectly), inability of the location 
     server to respond to a request, data connection failure, etc.
	 
     AEEGPS_ERR_INFO_UNAVAIL : This error indicates that some or all of the requested information
     is unavailable. (For example, the altitude information may be unavailable, but the 
     latitude/longitude information may be available.)  If there is no infomation available in fValid, 
     it means the device failed to obtain position for one of the following reasons:
     If using AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_NETWORK, the device failed to see a sufficient number of 
     CDMA pilots or GPS satellites in order to obtain a position.
     If using AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_LOCAL, the device failed to see a sufficinet number of satellites to 
     compute a position. This may occur if the mobile device is inside a building or a tunnel. 
     If the application repeatedly failes in this mode, it may attempt to use AEEGPS_MODE_TRACK_NETWORK 
     to obtain a position.
	 
     AEEGPS_ERR_ACCURACY_UNAVAIL : This error indicates the fix could not be obtained within the
     accuracy range requested by the accuracy parameter passed to IPOSDET_GetGPSInfo(). The application 
     may implement a retry mechanism to handle this error condition. NOTE:  This error code is not 
     currently returned by the BREW API.
	 
     AEEGPS_ERR_PRIVACY_REFUSED : This error indicates that the request was refused to 
     protect the device's privacy. This occurs if privacy is enforced at the device level 
     and the device rejects the position requests of the application. ISHELL_GetDeviceInfoEx()
     may be used to query if is enabled on the device.
	 
     AEEGPS_ERR_SRV_UNREACHABLE : This error is returned when the device fails to
     connect/communicate with the location server. Possible reasons for this error could 
     be that the IP address (which was set by application using IPOSDET_SetGPSConfig() or 
     is the default value provisioned into the device) is either incorrect or unavailable.
	 
     AEEGPS_ERR_LINK_FAILED : This error is returned when the communication link setup to 
     handle the position request is disrupted. Possible reasons for this error could be 
     that another entity (either user or a high priority program) preempted the session 
     causing the link for current request to fail. Another possible reason is that the wireless 
     link failed. This is likely a temporary failure and the application may re-try the request.
	 
     AEEGPS_ERR_REJECTED : One or more entities in the system rejected the position request.
	 
     AEEGPS_ERR_OUTOF_RESOURCES : This error is returned when the system does not have sufficient 
     resources to handle the position request. Resource contention could be coming from one or 
     more reasons, such as another position session, out of TCP sockets, a voice call or any other 
     traffic call is locking up resources, etc. This error most likely requires user intervention 
     in order for the re-tries to succeed.
	 
     AEEGPS_ERR_RECEIVER_BUSY : This error is returned when device radio receiver is temporarily 
     unavailable for position determination.~

IPosdet Interface

Description:

This interface provides services for position determination using GPS 
information or sector information. In order to use the GPS based position 
determination methods such as IPOSDET_SetGPSConfig(), IPOSDET_GetGPSConfig(), 
and IPOSDET_GetGPSInfo(), Position Determination Privileges (PL_POS_LOCATION) 
are required. Similarly, to use the sector-based position determination methods 
such as IPOSDET_GetSectorInfo(), SectorInfo privileges (PL_SECTORINFO) are 
required.

IPOSDET_GetGPSInfo() is an asynchronous method which uses AEECallback. Care
must be taken to ensure that the callbacks and information structures passed
to these methods by reference remain in scope until the callback returns.

Developers of Location Based Applications may use the BREW SDK to develop and
test their applications. The BREW SDK provides GPS emulation; users can set 
the GPS emulation in the Tools->GPS Emulation menu to use a pre-recorded NMEA 
file as GPS input, or connect an NMEA-output capable GPS device. An offline 
utility called NMEALogger.exe can be used to record an NMEA file from data coming 
from a GPS device connected to the serial port of the desktop/laptop. This NMEA 
file can be used later as GPS input. See the SDK User's Guide and the SDK 
Utilities Guide for details.

See the IPOSDET Use Case Scenarios for additional information.

IPOSDET_GetGPSInfo()

Description:
   This function returns information for GPS based position location. It returns
   latitude, longitude, altitude information, as well as vector information such as
   horizontal and vertical velocity, heading, and the uncertainity of the horizontal
   information. If the position request is not satisfactorily answered, the status 
   member of the AEEGPSInfo structure that is returned in the response will be non-zero 
   and will be set to one of the AEEGPS_ERR_* values.
   
   This is an asynchronous call which uses AEECallback. The callback specified by pcb 
   is called on completion. Care must be taken to ensure that the callbacks and 
   information structures passed to these methods by reference remain in scope until 
   the callback returns.

   This function enforces the privacy policies recommended by the network operator.
   Privacy implementation on the device may prompt the user using a dialog.
   Applications invoking this function must be prepared to surrender the screen for
   the dialog prompted to user. The application must suspend any paint to the screen 
   upon receipt of the event EVT_DIALOG_START and must redraw upon receipt of the event
   EVT_DIALOG_END.
