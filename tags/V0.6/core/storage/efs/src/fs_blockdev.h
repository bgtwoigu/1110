 * The blockdev API contains all the necessary interfaces to communicate
 * with a block device at the lowest abstraction layer. This includes
 * the common functions such as opening, reading and writing to a block
 * device as well as specific management functions such as hiding a block
 * device from discovery and returning device data from a block device.
