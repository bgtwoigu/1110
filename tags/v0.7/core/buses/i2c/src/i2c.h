when       who     what, where, why
--------   ---     -------------------------------------------------------
11/03/06   hz      Added support for 
                   a. Dynamic speed change: i2c_operation_fs_set(); 
                   b. Combined mode: i2c_combined_write_read(). 
05/22/06   dl      Added a function to invert i2c_ce pin.
03/24/06   dle     Added some stuff for new compiler.
                   buf_ptr is now byte *.
08/24/04   dle     Added back change history. Replace 3WIRE with
                   3WIRE_SW_CTRL with CE_CTRL and featuriz with
                   FEATURE_I2C_CHIP_ENABLE.
08/06/04   sch     Merged John Hacklander's changes to provide the same I2C
                   evironment as Jaguar.
05/24/03   dle     Featurized (FEATURE_I2C_IO_CTRL_OVER_H) options
                   (I2C_NOP_LAST_BYTE and I2C_CLK_START_BEFORE_RW) where there
                   is a need to switch to IO_CTRL in order to support these
                   options.
05/29/03   dle     Moved I2C_HW_CTRL_SCL_FREQ here.

FUNCTION i2c_init

DESCRIPTION
  This function intializes all I2C buses to a known state - SCL high, SDA
  high. It configures SCL and SDA as output.

  A fatal error is generated if an invalid bus id is specified, or if the
  specified bus is busy.

  Must be used before any of the I2C buses are used for I/O.

FUNCTION i2c_read

DESCRIPTION
  This function reads data from a slave device. The user should ensure that
  the correct options have been chosen to control the read operation.

  The read is aborted if the slave does not ack control/address bytes
  written to it (before the data read starts). A read operation is always
  terminated with a STOP condition.

  A fatal error is generated if an invalid bus id is specified, or if the
  bus is an inconsistent state (i.e Uninitialized, or busy).

  The following diagram shows the bus activity during a read. The second
  START shown is to be interpreted as a repeated START and may be replaced
  by a STOP and a START by some protocols.

FUNCTION i2c_write

DESCRIPTION
  This function writes data to a slave device. The user should ensure that
  the correct options have been chosen to control the write operation.

  The write is aborted if the slave does not ack control/address/data bytes
  written to it. The write operation is always terminated with a STOP
  condition.

  If a write is attempted with a count of zero, the slave is selected and a
  success is returned if the slave acks. Otherwise, a failure is returned.
  This is useful if one needs to test if a slave is addressable as in NVRAM
  devices that may be busy when doing internal cache-writes.

  A fatal error is generated if an invalid bus id is specified, or if the
  bus is busy.

  The following diagram shows the bus activity during a write operation.

FUNCTION i2c_combined_write_read

DESCRIPTION
  This function implemented I2C combined format operation. During a change
  of direction within a transfer, the START condition and the slave address
  are both repeated, but with the R/W bit reversed. If a master receiver sends
  a repeated START condition, it has previously sent a not-ACK.

  All decisions on auto-increment or decrement of previously accessed memory
  locations etc. are taken by the designer of the device.

  Each byte is followed by an acknowledgment bit as indicated by the ACK or 
  not-ACK blocks in the sequence.

  I2C-bus compatible devices must reset their bus logic on receipt of a START
  or repeated START condition such that they all anticipate the sending of a 
  slave address, even if these START conditions are not positioned according
  to the proper format.
                                                                     
  The following diagram shows the bus activity during a combined write-read
  operation.
