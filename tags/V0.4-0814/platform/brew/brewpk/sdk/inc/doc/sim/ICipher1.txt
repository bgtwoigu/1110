============================
ICipher1 simulation

ICipher1 is simumated. 
 
Cipher algorithms and software implementations
are simulated. Hardware CLSIDs of Cipher classes are defined
for OEM integration of hardware implementation of these
classes. QUALCOMM does not provide implementation for
these classes. (e.g.: AEECLSID_BLOCK_DES_HW and other
block and stream cipher CLSIDs that end with _HW).
