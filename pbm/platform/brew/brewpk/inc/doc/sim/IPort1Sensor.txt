Simulator Support DOCUMENTATION
============================
IPort1Sensor simulation

IPort1Sensor is simulated. Simulation supports the Sensors Message Protocol for the following commands
1. Set frequency 
2. Set calibration 
3. Get single shot 
4. Get auto generated data
5. Get conditional data
6. Get sys attributes

All data types exposed in the Sensors Message protocol document are supported.
Only attributes that are supported are Freq and calibrate.

Conditional Data is not fully supported. For example, the same client cannot request auto generated data and conditional data simultaneously. More than one condition cannot be active at the same time. Requesting more than 1 condition in the same command is supported, but stopping more than one condition in the same command is not supported.

Data is read from a data file if possible; else an internal counter is maintained and the value is incremented. The name of the data file has to be snsdata.txt. All the fileds in the file are mandatory. The maximum number of values supported per data type is 256. If more than 256 values are entered in the data file, the extra values are copied into the beginning of the array. The data file resides in the same location as simulator extension.

Simulator supports all the error codes that are listed in the Sensor Message Protocol. In addition, the following error codes are used as well

 C_INVALID_CLIENT_ERR = 16
 C_CMD_PARSE_ERR = 17
 C_CMD_MAX_LEN_EXCEEDED = 18
 C_CMD_COPY_FAILED = 19
 C_Q_FULL_ERR = 20

Note: When an app creates an instance of the IPortSensor interface, each instance takes up about 400KB of memory. So when more than one instance of the app needs to be instantiated, it is preferable to use DevicePack3 or DevicePack4 that have a bigger heap space.
