DESCRIPTION
  A simple sub-allocator to manage memory allocations and deallocations
  using a Next Fit strategy.  

  Note that these routines are FULLY re-entrant.  Furthermore, while
  performing memory allocation/deallocation calls on one heap, the routines
  may be interrupted to perform memory allocation/deallocation calls on
  different heaps without blocking or corruption.  However, should an
  interrupting task attempt to perform memory allocation/deallocation
  on the same heap that had a critical section interrupted, it will block
  allowing the first call to finish.  All this is accomplished by giving
  each heap its own semaphore.

  FEATURE_MEMHEAP_MT
    Activates multi threading support for the heap

  Usage Notes - Avoiding Fragmentation  
 
  1. If all bytes in the heap are freed, the heap is guaranteed to be returned
     to the same state as after a call to mem_init_heap, except that the
     values of maxUsed & maxRequest are not reset.  The order in which blocks
     are freed is irrelevant so long as they ALL are freed.
 
  2. After n consecutive malloc/calloc calls, in a heap with non-fragmented
     free space (and no intervening realloc calls that return a new pointer),
     calling free in the reverse order on the n blocks guarantees that the heap
     will be returned to the exact same state as before the n alloc calls.
 
  3. FEATURE_HEAP_SMALLER_OVERHEAD == 0
     (2) still applies, except the calls to free may be made in any order and
     after all n blocks are freed, the heap is guaranteed to be returned to the
     exact same state as prior to the n alloc calls.
 
  4. FEATURE_HEAP_SMALLER_OVERHEAD == 1
     The overhead per heap block is 8 bytes.  However it's not possible to backup
     the next-block-to-start-searching-for-free-space pointer, so the heap MAY
     become more fragmented, but it MAY NOT -- it depends on the alloc/free
     calling patterns.
 
  5. FEATURE_HEAP_SMALLER_OVERHEAD == 0
     The overhead per heap block is 12 bytes.  Backing up is possible, so some
     fragmention that otherwise MIGHT occur can be prevented.  There is very little
     performance cost for this, the big expense is the additional 4 bytes of overhead
     per heap block.

when       who     what, where, why
--------   ---     --------------------------------------------------------
03/31/009  sri     amssassert.h is further featurised based on APPS/QDSP6
09/01/004   gr     Deleted the context argument to the debug versions of
                   the memheap functions; the context is no longer used.
11/07/03    gr     More debug support.
09/23/03    gr     Added functions to retrieve information about a heap.
09/17/03    gr     Mainlined FEATURE_HEAP_DEBUG. Added support for storing a
                   filename hash and a line number in the block header.
03/11/03    gr     Added support for a heap-specific locking mechanism. This
                   allows some heaps to be restricted to task-context use,
                   and others to be usable from ISRs.
10/01/01    gr     Added support for some basic heap statistics.
11/17/00   crr     Change stdlib.h to stddef.h for size_t def. Add forward
                     decl for struct mem_heap_struct.
11/09/00   jct     Match to coding convention, remove of semaphore use, replace
                   with REX critical sections, remove stddef.h inclusion
02/17/99   kjm     Added realloc function.  Minor additions to
                     mem_heap_struct.  Added giant function descriptions.
11/24/98   kjm     Ported to C-only code for use in phone software from
                     original SubAllocator.h file.
08/22/97   kjm     Original SubAllocator.h file created.

DESCRIPTION
  Initializes the ioHeap object and sets up inMemoryChunk for use with the
  ioHeap object.  inMemoryChunk may be aligned on any boundary.  Beginning
  bytes will be skipped until a paragraph boundary is reached.  Do NOT pass
  in NULL pointers.  inFailProc may be NULL in which case no function will
  be called if mem_malloc or mem_calloc is about to fail.  If inFailProc
  is provided, it will be called once and then the allocation will be
  attempted again.  See description of my_allocator_failed_proc for details.
  There is no protection for initializing a heap more than once.  If a heap
  is re-initialized, all pointers previously allocated from the heap are
  immediately invalidated and their contents possibly destroyed.  If that's
  the desired behavior, a heap may be initialized more than once.

FUNCTION MEM_REALLOC

DESCRIPTION
  Resizes the ptr block of memory to be size bytes while preserving the
  block's contents.  If the block is shortened, bytes are discarded off the
  end.  If the block is lengthened, the new bytes added are not initialized
  and will have garbage values.  If heap_ptr is NULL, the contents of ptr are
  unchanged and the function silently returns NULL.  If ptr is NULL, the
  functions behaves exactly like mem_malloc (see above).  If ptr is not NULL
  and size is 0, the function behaves exactly like mem_free (see below).  If
  the block cannot be resized, ptr is not NULL and size is not 0, then NULL
  is returned and the original block is left untouched.  If the ptr block IS
  successfully resized and the returned value is different from the ptr value
  passed in, the old block passed in must be considered deallocated and no
  longer useable (i.e. do NOT try to mem_free it!)  This function will ASSERT
  if it can detect a bad pointer or a pointer to a free block within the
  range of memory managed by heap_ptr.  However, it's not always possible to
  do this.  Passing in a ptr block that is outside the memory managed by
  heap_ptr will result in a silent return of NULL with the contents of ptr
  unchanged.  This function will call mem_malloc if it can't grow the block
  in place, so the allocater failed function WILL be called if the heap is
  out of room to grow the block.

  Returns a pointer to the beginning of the resized block of memory (which
  may be different than ptr) or NULL if the block cannot be resized.
