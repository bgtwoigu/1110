  This function is called by L3 when a CLAM is received, to check if the tag

DEPENDENCIES
  We assume that tag id is uniquely maintained, i.e., no two active tags have 
  the same tag id.

RETURN VALUE
  TURE if a tag is active. Tag info is copied to the pointer supplied by the 
  caller.

RETURN VALUE

  taken out of the outstanding list.

FUNCTION mcctctag_get_first_found_data_call

DESCRIPTION
  This function retruns tag information for the first outstanding
  data call found in the list.  This is needed because when we get 
  "retry_order" for data EOM, there is no tag info in the order but
  CP needs to tell CM about the retry delay so that DS can update value
  accordingly. So the only way CP knows which call this is, is by doing a
  serach for data SO in the tag outstanding list. If there is more than 1
  data call in the list, only the first one will be removed (This is due
  to the std pitfall)
  
DEPENDENCIES
  None

RETURN VALUE
  TURE if a tag with data SO is active. Tag info is copied to the pointer supplied by the 
  caller.
  FALSE if there is no active TAG for a DATA SO. 

SIDE EFFECTS
  If a matching tag is found and active, it will become inactive.

DESCRIPTION
  This function check to see if a tag identified by tag id is active. If the 
  tag is found, the eom is marked as L2 ACK received. 
  
  This function is called by L3 when ACK is received for EOM.

  the same tag id.

DESCRIPTION
  This function checks to see if a tag identified by the SR ID is 
  outstanding. If yes, this tag will be removed from the outstanding list.
  The info associated with the tag will be returned to the caller.
  
  This function is called when a connection restored by SCM.
